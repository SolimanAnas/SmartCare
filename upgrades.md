# 🔐 UPGRADES.md — Secure SDLC Compliance Plan

**Project:** DCAS CPG 2025 — Clinical Review Platform
**Assessed against:** *Dubai Corporate for Ambulance Services — Software Development Life Cycle Policy and Procedure* (Secure SDLC Policy and Procedure), Version 1.1, dated 07-02-2025, Classification: **Shared – Confidential**
**Assessment date:** 2026-06-08
**Document owner of policy:** Asma Omar Muallemi (Principal Information Security Specialist)
**Repository scanned:** `SolimanAnas/CPG-2025` @ branch `claude/cpg-2025-swot-its-compliance-GaiuJ`

## 1. Executive Summary

The DCAS CPG 2025 platform is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that digitises the 2025 Clinical Practice Guidelines for DCAS EMS personnel. It pairs a static Vanilla-JS/HTML/CSS front-end with a Flask + SQLite back-end that provides authentication (email/password + Google OAuth 2.0) and an IT admin console for managing registered clinical staff (PII: full names, emails, professional levels).

Measured against the DCAS Secure SDLC Policy, the repository is currently **largely non-compliant**. The product was clearly built feature-first with no formal secure-SDLC artefacts (no risk assessment, no security requirements, no design documents, no secure-coding standard, no security testing evidence, no separation of environments). More urgently, the scan surfaced **critical, exploitable security defects** that directly contradict the policy's mandatory statements — most notably a **completely unauthenticated admin endpoint and admin dashboard that expose all registered users' personal data**, **client-side-only "admin" authentication with a hard-coded credential hash**, **hard-coded secrets**, and a **user database (with PII) committed into git history**.

This document delivers three things requested:
1. A **SWOT analysis** of the project (§3).
2. A **clause-by-clause compliance gap analysis** of the repo against the policy (§4) plus the **detailed security findings** behind it (§5).
3. A **phased, detailed remediation roadmap** to reach compliance (§6), with a quick-win checklist (§7) and the ISR v3 / ISO 27001:2022 traceability matrix (§8).

> ⚠️ **Classification note:** The source policy is *Shared – Confidential*. This compliance plan inherits that sensitivity. Do not distribute outside authorised DCAS audiences.

## 2. What Was Scanned (Repository Overview)

| Area | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Front-end** | `index.html`, `app.js` (≈55 KB), `styles.css`, `sw.js` (service worker), `manifest.json`, 101 chapter pages, 65 content modules, 31 sub-pages (login, signup, admin, drug calculator, ECG engine, quizzes). |
| **Back-end** | Flask app — **`server.py` is referenced by `Procfile`, `requirements.txt`, and `tests/` but has been *deleted* from the working tree** (commits `b7eceb5 Delete server.py`, `3d93108 Delete server.py`). Recovered from history for this review. |
| **Auth** | Email/password (Werkzeug PBKDF2 hash), Google OAuth 2.0, Flask-Login sessions. Client-side "local admin" fallback in `pages/login.html`. |
| **Data** | `users.db` SQLite (PII). `data/*.json`, `src/**/*.json` quiz banks, `pdf_sections/*.pdf` clinical PDFs. |
| **CI/CD** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — Ruff + pytest + ESLint + Prettier, runs on `main`. Deploy: Render (`Procfile`, `gunicorn server:app`). |
| **Tests** | `tests/test_api.py`, `tests/conftest.py` — API smoke tests. |
| **Tooling** | `pyproject.toml` (Ruff, pytest), `requirements.txt`, `server.bat` (Windows dev launcher). |

**Stack:** Python 3 / Flask 3.0.3 / Flask-SQLAlchemy / Flask-Login / Werkzeug 3.0.3 / google-auth / Gunicorn · Vanilla JS (ES6) · Service Worker PWA · SQLite · Render hosting · GitHub Actions.

## 3. SWOT Analysis

### 💪 Strengths
- **Working CI pipeline exists** (`ci.yml`): linting (Ruff/ESLint/Prettier) + automated pytest API tests already wired to `main` — a foundation to build secure-SDLC gates on.
- **Application-factory pattern** (`create_app(test_config)`) and a test suite with fixtures (`conftest.py`) — testable architecture, good for adding security tests.
- **Passwords are hashed** with Werkzeug `generate_password_hash` (PBKDF2-SHA256), not stored in plaintext.
- **OAuth token verified server-side** via `google-auth` (`id_token.verify_oauth2_token`) — correct pattern.
- **Secrets are read from environment variables** (`SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`) in CI, showing awareness of externalised config.
- **Zero-dependency front-end** reduces the third-party supply-chain attack surface on the client.
- **Linting standards defined** in `pyproject.toml` (Ruff E/F/W/I, line length, format rules) — a basis for the mandated Secure Coding Standards.

### 🩹 Weaknesses
- **No secure-SDLC artefacts at all:** no risk assessment, security requirements, design/architecture (SAD) document, secure-coding standard, threat model, or security-test evidence — every phase of Policy §4 is undocumented.
- **Critical broken access control:** `/api/admin/users` and `pages/admin.html` have **no server-side authentication or authorisation** — anyone can list, and (per client code) change roles / delete users.
- **Client-side-only admin auth** with a **hard-coded credential hash** baked into `pages/login.html` (line 363) — trivially bypassed.
- **Hard-coded fallback secrets** in `server.py` (`SECRET_KEY = "dcas-cpg-2025-secure-key"`, a real-looking `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`).
- **PII database committed to git history** (`instance/users.db`, commits `99cd25c`, `292c5bc`); **no `.gitignore`**.
- **Repo is internally inconsistent / build-broken:** `server.py` deleted but still referenced by `Procfile`/`requirements.txt`/tests → **CI tests cannot import the app**; CI also references a non-existent `.eslintrc.json` → JS lint step fails.
- **No environment separation** (dev/SIT/UAT/prod) — single SQLite file, `debug=True` in run, no masked test data.
- **No security headers, rate limiting, account lockout, password policy, CSRF protection, or audit logging.**
- **No SAST / dependency / secret scanning** in CI.
- **No `SECURITY.md`, no vulnerability-disclosure process, no documented release/change management.**

### 🚀 Opportunities
- **Low-cost, high-impact hardening:** most critical findings (auth gate, secret rotation, `.gitignore`, headers) are small, well-understood fixes.
- **CI is the natural enforcement point** — add SAST (Bandit/CodeQL/Semgrep), `pip-audit`, Gitleaks, and security tests to mechanically satisfy Policy §5 "Source Code Scanning" and "Software Security Testing".
- **`SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS.md` + `SECURE_CODING_STANDARD.md` + `SAD.md`** can be authored once and reused as the mandated documentation set.
- **Aligns to two external frameworks at once:** remediation maps cleanly to **ISR v3** and **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** controls (Policy §9–§10), supporting the annual internal audit (§11).
- **Maturing this repo creates a reusable DCAS secure-SDLC template** for future internal apps.

### ⚠️ Threats
- **Active PII exposure** of DCAS clinical staff (names, emails, professional level) via the open admin endpoint — **data-protection / regulatory exposure** under Dubai data-protection expectations and Policy statement §3.5.
- **Account/role tampering & deletion** by unauthenticated actors if the admin write endpoints are live in production.
- **Werkzeug debugger RCE** if `debug=True` reaches production (info disclosure + remote code execution via the interactive debugger).
- **Leaked secrets in git history** remain exploitable until rotated, even after deletion.
- **Policy §11 enforcement:** violations are reportable to the Information Security Steering Committee (DCASISSC); the platform would **fail the mandated annual internal security audit** and the **pre-deployment security sign-off** (§5 "Software Security Testing", ISR 8.7.2).
- **Outsourced/contributor risk:** no enforced secure-coding standard means new contributions can reintroduce the same defect classes.

## 5. Critical Security Findings (Evidence)

> These are the concrete defects driving the 🔴 ratings above. Severity uses CVSS-style qualitative bands. Fix the **Critical/High** items before any production deployment (Policy §8 / ISR 8.7.1).

### 🔴 F-01 — Unauthenticated admin endpoint exposes all user PII *(Critical — Broken Access Control)*
- **Where:** recovered `server.py` → `@app.route('/api/admin/users', methods=['GET'])` / `get_all_users()` has **no `@login_required` and no role check**. Confirmed by `tests/test_api.py::TestAdminUsers::test_admin_users_empty` expecting `200` with **no auth**.
- **Impact:** Any anonymous caller retrieves every registered user's `full_name`, `email`, and `role` (clinical staff PII). `pages/admin.html` additionally calls `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}/role` and `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}` — if live, unauthenticated **role escalation and account deletion**.
- **Violates:** Policy §3.5, §4.4(c); ISR 8.4.2 / 8.7.2; ISO A.8.26.

### 🔴 F-02 — Admin dashboard has no authentication gate *(Critical — Broken Access Control)*
- **Where:** `pages/admin.html` — no `AUTH_KEY`/session check, no redirect; it just `fetch('/api/admin/users')` on load. README markets `/api/admin/users` as a "hidden, protected directory dashboard" — it is neither hidden nor protected.
- **Impact:** Navigating to `/pages/admin.html` renders the full user list and management controls.

### 🔴 F-03 — Client-side-only admin auth with hard-coded credential hash *(High — Auth Bypass)*
- **Where:** `pages/login.html:363` — hard-coded `password: '5fb2127d…fea7d7e'` and `tryLocalAdmin()` comparing PBKDF2 hashes **in the browser**; auth state persisted via `localStorage.setItem(AUTH_KEY, …)`.
- **Impact:** Authentication decided client-side is forgeable (set `localStorage` directly); the admin hash is exposed to anyone who views source and is offline-crackable.
- **Violates:** Policy §4.4(c) "strong authentication and authorization"; ISR 5.2.1.5.

### 🔴 F-04 — Hard-coded secrets in source *(High — Secrets Management)*
- **Where:** `server.py` → `SECRET_KEY` default `"dcas-cpg-2025-secure-key"`; `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` hard-coded `413832763437-…apps.googleusercontent.com` (also in `pages/login.html:335`).
- **Impact:** A predictable Flask `SECRET_KEY` allows **session cookie forgery**. Secrets in VCS persist in history.
- **Violates:** Policy §3.4; ISR 8.2.x; ISO A.8.25.

### 🔴 F-05 — PII database committed to git history; no `.gitignore` *(High — Data Protection)*
- **Where:** `instance/users.db` added in commits `99cd25c`, `292c5bc`; later deleted but **retained in history**. No `.gitignore` in repo.
- **Impact:** Cloning the repo yields historical user data. **Test/prod data must never live in the dev repo** (Policy §8.2).
- **Violates:** Policy §8.2, §3.5; ISO A.8.33.

### 🟠 F-06 — Flask `debug=True` in run path *(High if prod — Info Disclosure / RCE)*
- **Where:** `server.py` → `app.run(debug=True, port=8899)`.
- **Impact:** Werkzeug interactive debugger enables stack-trace disclosure and **remote code execution** if reachable in production.
- **Violates:** Policy §4.6(a) secure deployment configuration.

### 🟠 F-07 — No password policy / rate limiting / lockout *(Medium — Auth Hardening)*
- **Where:** `register()` accepts any non-empty password (tests use `"pw"`); `login()` has no throttling.
- **Impact:** Weak passwords + unlimited brute-force attempts.
- **Violates:** Policy §4.2(b); ISR 5.2.1.5.

### 🟠 F-08 — No security headers / transport hardening *(Medium)*
- **Missing:** CSP, HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`/frame-ancestors, `Referrer-Policy`, secure+`HttpOnly`+`SameSite` cookie flags.
- **Violates:** Policy §3.5, §4.3(c).

### 🟡 F-09 — Input validation & XSS surface *(Medium)*
- **Where:** 29 files use `innerHTML` (`app.js`, `pages/drug-calculator.js`, `src/prometric/exam.js`, …). Server `register()` does minimal validation; no output encoding standard.
- **Impact:** Reflected/stored XSS risk if any user-controlled data flows to `innerHTML`.
- **Violates:** Policy §4.4(a) (XSS), §4.5(b); ISR 8.3.x.

### 🟡 F-10 — Build-broken / inconsistent repo *(Medium — Configuration Mgmt & VC)*
- **Where:** `server.py` deleted but referenced by `Procfile` (`gunicorn server:app`), `requirements.txt`, and `tests/conftest.py` (`from server import create_app`). CI references **non-existent `.eslintrc.json`**.
- **Impact:** **CI cannot pass** (pytest import error; ESLint config-not-found). Back-end is effectively un-version-controlled.
- **Violates:** Policy §3.10, §7 "Source Code Version Control"; ISO A.8.32.

### 🟡 F-11 — No SAST / dependency / secret scanning in CI *(Medium)*
- **Impact:** Mandatory "Static Source Code Scanning" and pre-deploy security verification are absent.
- **Violates:** Policy §5/§7 "Source Code Scanning" & "Software Security Testing"; ISR 8.6.1/8.6.2.

### 🟡 F-12 — No audit logging / monitoring *(Medium)*
- **Impact:** No record of admin actions, logins, or failures → no detection or post-incident review.
- **Violates:** Policy §4.7(b), §3.9 (Security Monitoring); ISO A.8.34.

## 6. Detailed Remediation Plan (Roadmap to Compliance)

The plan is organised into four phases. Each task lists **Policy/ISR/ISO mapping**, the **owner role from the policy's taxonomy**, and a **rough effort** (S ≤½ day, M ≈1–2 days, L ≈3–5 days). Treat Phase 0 as a release blocker.

### 🚨 Phase 0 — Emergency Containment (Days 0–2) — *fix before any further deployment*

| ID | Action | Maps to | Owner | Effort |
|----|--------|---------|-------|:------:|
| P0-1 | **Restore `server.py` to version control** (commit the recovered file) so the back-end is governed by VC again, OR formally remove all references if the backend is retired. | §7 VC; F-10 | Configuration Manager | S |
| P0-2 | **Lock down admin:** add `@login_required` **and** an `is_admin`/role check to `/api/admin/users` (GET) and the role/delete endpoints; return `403` for non-admins. Add a server-side gate (session check) before rendering `admin.html`. | §4.4(c); ISR 8.4.2/8.7.2; F-01/F-02 | Developer + ISO | M |
| P0-3 | **Remove client-side admin auth** and the hard-coded hash from `pages/login.html`; route all auth through the server. | §4.4(c); F-03 | Developer | M |
| P0-4 | **Rotate & externalise secrets:** generate a new `SECRET_KEY`, remove all hard-coded fallbacks, fail-fast if env vars are unset; rotate the Google OAuth client secret. | §3.4; ISR 8.2.x; F-04 | ISO | S |
| P0-5 | **Add `.gitignore`** (`instance/`, `*.db`, `*.sqlite*`, `.env`, `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `node_modules/`) and **purge `instance/users.db` from git history** (`git filter-repo`/BFG) then force-rotate any exposed creds. Notify DCASISSC per §11 if PII exposure is confirmed. | §8.2; ISO A.8.33; F-05 | ISO + Configuration Manager | M |
| P0-6 | **Disable debug in production:** drive `debug` from `FLASK_DEBUG`/`APP_ENV`, default `False`; ensure Gunicorn (not `app.run`) serves prod. | §4.6(a); F-06 | Developer | S |
| P0-7 | **Set secure cookie flags** (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE/HTTPONLY/SAMESITE`) and confirm HTTPS-only on Render. | §3.5; F-08 | Developer | S |

### 🟧 Phase 1 — Restore a Green, Security-Gated Pipeline (Week 1)

| ID | Action | Maps to | Owner | Effort |
|----|--------|---------|-------|:------:|
| P1-1 | Fix CI: make tests importable again (P0-1), add the **missing `.eslintrc.json`**, ensure Ruff+pytest+ESLint pass; extend CI triggers to feature branches/PRs. | §3.10; F-10 | Developer | M |
| P1-2 | **Add SAST:** Bandit (Python) + CodeQL or Semgrep in CI; fail build on High/Critical. Satisfies "Static Source Code Scanning". | §7; ISR 8.6.1/8.6.2; F-11 | ISO | M |
| P1-3 | **Add dependency scanning:** `pip-audit` (and `npm audit` for dev deps) + Dependabot. | §4.7(a); ISO A.8.25 | ISO | S |
| P1-4 | **Add secret scanning:** Gitleaks/TruffleHog in CI + GitHub secret-scanning push protection. | §3.4; F-04 | ISO | S |
| P1-5 | **Add a security sign-off gate:** required PR status checks + CODEOWNERS requiring ISO review on `server.py`, auth, and CI changes — implements ISR 8.7.2 pre-deploy sign-off. | ISR 8.7.2; ISO A.8.30 | CISO/ISO | M |
| P1-6 | Add `SECURITY.md` (vulnerability-disclosure contact + process). | §4.7; F-12 | ISO | S |

### 🟨 Phase 2 — Secure-by-Design Controls in Code (Weeks 2–3)

| ID | Action | Maps to | Owner | Effort |
|----|--------|---------|-------|:------:|
| P2-1 | **Password policy** (min length/complexity, block common passwords) + server-side validation on `register`. | §4.2(b); ISR 5.2.1.5; F-07 | Developer | M |
| P2-2 | **Rate limiting & lockout** on `/api/login`, `/api/register`, `/api/google-login` (e.g. Flask-Limiter) + generic error messages (no user enumeration). | §4.4(c); F-07 | Developer | M |
| P2-3 | **Centralised input validation & output encoding**; replace unsafe `innerHTML` with `textContent`/sanitised templating; add CSP to block inline-script XSS. | §4.4(a), §4.5(b); ISR 8.3.x; F-09 | Developer | L |
| P2-4 | **Security headers middleware** (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, frame-ancestors, Referrer-Policy) via Flask-Talisman or `after_request`. | §3.5; F-08 | Developer | M |
| P2-5 | **Audit logging** for auth events and all admin actions (login success/fail, role change, delete) with timestamp + actor; ship to a monitored sink. | §4.7(b); §3.9; ISO A.8.34; F-12 | Developer + ISO | M |
| P2-6 | **Encrypt data at rest:** move off plaintext SQLite for prod (managed Postgres with encryption) or SQLCipher; document keys per Encryption & Key Management Policy. | §8.4; ISR 8.x | ISO | L |
| P2-7 | **CSRF protection** for any cookie-authenticated state-changing route. | §4.2(b) | Developer | S |

### 🟩 Phase 3 — Secure-SDLC Documentation & Process (Weeks 3–6)

Produce the mandatory artefact set the policy requires for every project. These are one-time authorings that become the reusable DCAS template.

### 8.2 ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Policy §10)

| Control | Title | Status | Evidence |
|---------|-------|:------:|---------|
| A.5.8 | Information security in project management | 🟢 | `RISK_ASSESSMENT.md`; security objectives in all phase docs |
| A.8.25 | Secure development life cycle | 🟢 | All `docs/security/` artefacts; CI pipeline; sign-off gate docs |
| A.8.26 | Application security requirements | 🟢 | `docs/requirements.md`; server-side auth/authz enforced |
| A.8.28 *(implied)* | Secure coding | 🟢 | `SECURE_CODING_STANDARD.md`; Bandit; Ruff; CODEOWNERS |

## 9. Recommended Sequencing & Effort

| Phase | Theme | Window | Blocker? |
|-------|-------|--------|:--------:|
| **0** | Emergency containment (F-01…F-07) | Days 0–2 | ✅ Yes — release blocker |
| **1** | Green, security-gated CI/CD | Week 1 | ✅ Yes |
| **2** | Secure-by-design controls in code | Weeks 2–3 | High |
| **3** | Secure-SDLC documentation & process | Weeks 3–6 | Required for audit sign-off |

**Definition of "compliant" for sign-off (per Policy §8 / ISR 8.7.2):** all Phase 0–2 findings closed and verified by IT Security, the mandatory documentation set (Phase 3) authored and approved by the Information Security Section, CI security gates green, and a formal pre-deployment **security sign-off** recorded before the next production release. An **annual internal audit** report is then submitted to the DCAS Information Security Steering Committee (DCASISSC) per Policy §11.
