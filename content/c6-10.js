            <h3 style="color:var(--primary-accent);">?? Nausea and Vomiting</h3>
            
            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify life-threatening causes associated with nausea and vomiting.</li>
                <li>Improve patient comfort.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients presenting with nausea and/or vomiting, including traumatic and non-traumatic causes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>None noted.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secondary Survey:</strong> Perform a focused physical examination to identify potential causes of nausea and vomiting.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient History:</strong> Use OPQRST and SAMPLE history to identify potentially serious underlying causes.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine Triage Category:</strong> Red priority for persistent vomiting, hematemesis, signs of shock, or suspected pregnancy complications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary and Secondary Surveys:</strong> Perform as per Universal Care CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider Red Flags:</strong> Persistent vomiting or hematemesis; suspected pregnancy complications (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage).</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluate for Signs of Shock or Instability:</strong> Hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg in adults, or age-specific for pediatrics); tachycardia (HR >100 in adults, or age-specific); altered mental status; poor perfusion (cool, clammy skin, delayed capillary refill).</li>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back-up:</strong> For unstable patients or those requiring advanced care. It is generally not appropriate to request ALS back-up for the administration of antiemetics alone.</li>
                <li><strong>Establish IV Access:</strong> Indicated for dehydration, hypotension, or anticipated medication administration.</li>
                <li><strong>Fluid Resuscitation:</strong> For signs of shock or dehydration:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adults: 500-1000 mL bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate, reassess, repeat as needed.</li>
                        <li>Pediatrics: 20 mL/kg bolus, reassess, repeat as needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Medication Administration:</strong> For nausea/vomiting, administer metoclopramide:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adults: 10 mg IV/IM (slow IV over 3 minutes, or diluted in 100 mL normal saline as an infusion).</li>
                        <li>Pediatrics: Not recommended for routine pediatric administration due to risk of extrapyramidal effects; use only if clearly indicated and after consultation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pain Management:</strong> Assess and manage pain as per Pain Management CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Reassessment:</strong> Frequently reassess vital signs, hydration status, and response to interventions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Nausea and vomiting typically have an underlying cause; do not assume it is benign.</li>
                <li>Prophylactic administration of anti-nausea medications for opiates (e.g., morphine) is not recommended.</li>
                <li>Metoclopramide should not be mixed with morphine.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Common causes: gastroenteritis, appendicitis, bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, DKA, pregnancy, head injury, myocardial infarction, and medication side effects.</li>
                <li>In children, consider intussusception, pyloric stenosis, or viral illness.</li>
                <li>In elderly, consider myocardial infarction, infection, or bowel obstruction.</li>
                <li>Vomiting can lead to dehydration and electrolyte disturbances; assess for signs of hypovolemia.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Onset, duration, frequency, character of vomitus (e.g., bilious, bloody, projectile).</li>
                <li>Associated symptoms (abdominal pain, headache, fever, diarrhea).</li>
                <li>Vital signs, signs of dehydration, mental status.</li>
                <li>Fluids administered, antiemetics given, response.</li>
                <li>Transport decision and hospital notification.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Administer an antiemetic to all patients with moderate to severe nausea or vomiting (unless contraindicated or inappropriate).</li>
            </ul>
