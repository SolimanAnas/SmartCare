            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>General Impression:</strong> Use the Pediatric or Adult Assessment Triangle; look for distress, pallor, respiratory difficulty, or altered mental status.</li>
                <li><strong>Airway & Breathing:</strong> Assess for tachypnea, hypoxia, or signs of acute chest syndrome (cough, chest pain, crackles).</li>
                <li><strong>Circulation:</strong> Check capillary refill, heart rate, blood pressure, and perfusion; look for signs of dehydration or hypotension.</li>
                <li><strong>Pain Assessment:</strong> Assess pain as per Pain Management CPG (0-10 scale, Wong-Baker, FLACC).</li>
                <li><strong>Neurological Assessment:</strong> Evaluate for headache, confusion, focal deficits, or seizure activity (possible stroke).</li>
                <li><strong>History (SAMPLE/OPQRST):</strong> Past similar episodes, baseline functional level; medications (e.g., hydroxyurea, analgesics); last crisis or transfusion; any recent illness or dehydration; fever or infection risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine Triage Category:</strong> Red priority for chest pain, respiratory distress, altered mental status, stroke symptoms, or severe pain.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back-up:</strong> For patients with altered mental status, respiratory distress, signs of stroke, or requiring IV opioid management.</li>
                <li><strong>Pain Management:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reassure and position for comfort.</li>
                        <li>Administer appropriate analgesia early as per Pain Management CPG.</li>
                        <li>IV analgesics are likely to be required (e.g., IV morphine, IV paracetamol).</li>
                        <li>Avoid delays in pain relief � consider escalation to ALS for opioid administration.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen Therapy:</strong> Administer oxygen if SpO2 <94% or signs of respiratory compromise; target SpO2 =94%; avoid hyperoxia.</li>
                <li><strong>IV Access & Fluids:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Establish IV access.</li>
                        <li>Fluid resuscitation: Indications � signs of dehydration, fever, vomiting, or hypotension.</li>
                        <li>Adults: 250 mL IV bolus, may be repeated if required.</li>
                        <li>Pediatrics: 10-20 mL/kg IV bolus, may be repeated if required.</li>
                        <li>Avoid large-volume fluid boluses unless the patient is hypotensive.</li>
                        <li>If acute chest syndrome is suspected, fluid administration should be minimized and closely monitored.</li>
                        <li>Titrate fluids to improve perfusion rather than normalize blood pressure.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Monitor for Complications:</strong> Consider alternative causes of pain and symptoms (e.g., acute chest syndrome, stroke, sepsis). Provide additional treatment as per relevant CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Reassessment:</strong> Frequently reassess vital signs, pain level, and neurological status.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not delay pain relief � early treatment improves patient outcomes.</li>
                <li>Avoid aggressive fluid administration in patients with chest pain symptoms (may worsen acute chest syndrome).</li>
                <li>Monitor closely for deterioration (e.g., increasing respiratory rate, reduced GCS).</li>
                <li>Use weight-based dosing; refer to Broselow tape for pediatric patients.</li>
                <li>Avoid causing stress or cold exposure, which may precipitate crisis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Sickle cell crises are painful and time-sensitive emergencies; early pain relief is critical.</li>
                <li>Many patients have individualized treatment plans; involve caregivers when appropriate.</li>
                <li>Recurrent pain does not mean drug-seeking; treat all reported pain seriously.</li>
                <li>Acute chest syndrome is the most life-threatening complication; recognize and report early (chest pain, cough, hypoxia, fever).</li>
                <li>Fever in a sickle cell patient is always a red flag for possible sepsis.</li>
                <li>If in doubt, consult Tele-EMS or request ALS backup for escalation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>

                <li>Pain location, severity (pre- and post-treatment), vital signs, SpO2.</li>
                <li>Fluids administered (type, volume), oxygen, analgesia given (dose, route, time).</li>
                <li>Any complications (acute chest syndrome, stroke signs).</li>
                <li>Response to treatment, hospital notification.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Assess and document pain using an appropriate pain scale.</li>
                <li>Administer appropriate analgesia within 15 minutes of arrival.</li>
