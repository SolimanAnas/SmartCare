                <li>Identify life-threatening conditions quickly to facilitate immediate interventions while maximizing the number of survivors.</li>
                <li>Ensure efficient scene management and transport decisions based on patient priority.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sequential Evaluation (START Algorithm):</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Global Command:</strong> "If you can hear me and are able to walk, come to my voice." � all walking/ambulatory patients are categorized as <strong>Green (Minor)</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>For non-ambulatory patients:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Breathing:</strong> Is the patient breathing spontaneously? If no ? position airway; if still not breathing ? <strong>Black (Expectant)</strong>. If breathing returns ? continue.</li>

                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Immediate (Red):</strong> Requires urgent intervention; life-threatening condition.</li>
                        <li><strong>Delayed (Yellow):</strong> Serious but not immediately life-threatening.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minor (Green):</strong> Walking wounded; minimal injuries.</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start with Global Command:</strong> Instruct all ambulatory patients to walk to a designated area; tag them as Green.</li>
                <li><strong>For non-ambulatory patients, apply START algorithm:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open airway if apneic; if breathing resumes, tag Red.</li>
                        <li>If respiratory rate >30, tag Red.</li>
                        <li>If radial pulse absent or capillary refill >2 sec, tag Red.</li>
                        <li>If mental status altered (does not obey commands), tag Red.</li>
                        <li>Otherwise, tag Yellow.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Apply basic interventions during triage:</strong> Airway positioning for apnea; control massive hemorrhage if identified.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration with Incident Command:</strong> Report triage numbers to incident commander; adjust based on available resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Reassessment:</strong> Reassess patients as resources allow; triage categories may change with deterioration or improvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Scene Safety: Prioritize personal protective equipment; avoid entering unsafe areas during initial triage.</li>
                <li>Do not delay transport of Red patients for detailed on-scene interventions.</li>
                <li>Apply triage tags to all patients to ensure proper prioritization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) is designed for use by first responders without advanced equipment.</li>
                <li>Children may be triaged using a modified pediatric version (JumpSTART) if resources allow.</li>
                <li>In an MCI, the goal is to do the greatest good for the greatest number; some patients may be classified as Expectant if resources are overwhelmed.</li>
                <li>Triage tags should be placed on each patient; colour-coded tags (red, yellow, green, black) help with scene management.</li>
                <li>Document triage category and any interventions on the tag; communicate numbers to command.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Number of patients by triage category.</li>
                <li>Individual patient triage category (tag colour).</li>
                <li>Any interventions performed (airway positioning, hemorrhage control).</li>
                <li>Time of triage and transport priority.</li>
                <li>Communication with incident command.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete triage assessment within 30 seconds (per patient).</li>
                <li>Apply a triage tag to all patients triaged.</li>
