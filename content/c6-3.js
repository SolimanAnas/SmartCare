            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapid recognition and treatment of adrenal crisis to prevent cardiovascular collapse.</li>

                <li>None � treat empirically if suspicion is high.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patient History:</strong> Known adrenal insufficiency, recent steroid use, autoimmune disease, recent infection, surgery, or trauma; check for medical alert bracelets.</li>
                <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Severe weakness, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, seizures.</li>
                <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Hypotension (especially postural), tachycardia, fever, hyperpigmentation (chronic), hypoglycemia, hyponatremia (if labs available).</li>
                <li><strong>Consider in any patient with:</strong> Unexplained hypotension, poor response to fluids, or hyperkalemia (if known).</li>
                <li><strong>Exclude other causes:</strong> Sepsis, hypovolemia, cardiac shock, anaphylaxis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Survey:</strong> Ensure airway patency, adequate breathing, and circulation. Give high-flow oxygen if hypoxic.</li>
                <li><strong>Circulation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Establish IV/IO access.</li>
                        <li>Administer fluid bolus: <strong>500-1000 mL crystalloid (e.g., normal saline)</strong> rapidly; reassess.</li>
                        <li>If no improvement, consider additional fluids and immediate corticosteroid administration.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Glucose:</strong> Check blood glucose. If <70 mg/dL, give 50% dextrose 25 g IV (or 10% dextrose infusion).</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrocortisone:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Administer hydrocortisone <strong>100 mg IV/IM</strong> as soon as possible.</li>
                        <li>If hydrocortisone unavailable, consider methylprednisolone 50-100 mg IV or dexamethasone 4-8 mg IV.</li>
                        <li>Do not delay steroids for diagnostic tests.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Continuous ECG, pulse oximetry, blood pressure every 5-10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Observe for response to fluids and steroids (usually improves within 30-60 minutes).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Transport:</strong> Priority to nearest appropriate facility; notify receiving hospital of adrenal crisis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapid deterioration can occur � monitor closely.</li>
                <li>Fluid resuscitation may need to be repeated; avoid excessive fluid in patients with heart failure.</li>
                <li>If patient has known steroid use, do not withhold steroids even if crisis not definite.</li>
                <li>Hypoglycemia is common � treat aggressively.</li>
                <li>Addisonian crisis is difficult to diagnose; most patients will inform you � check for medical alert bracelets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Adrenal crisis can mimic septic shock; give steroids early if there is any suspicion.</li>
                <li>Patients on chronic steroids may not have the classic hyperpigmentation.</li>
                <li>If patient is unable to take oral maintenance steroids, IM/IV hydrocortisone is life-saving.</li>
                <li>Document time of steroid administration � crucial for ongoing hospital care.</li>
                <li>Common causes: medication non-compliance, infection, trauma, surgery, dehydration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>History of adrenal insufficiency, steroid use, presenting symptoms.</li>
                <li>Vital signs, blood glucose, response to fluids and steroids.</li>
                <li>Medication(s) given (dose, route, time).</li>
                <li>Fluids administered.</li>
                <li>Hospital notification and transport details.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hydrocortisone administered to suspected adrenal crisis within 30 minutes of identification.</li>
                <li>Blood glucose checked and treated if <70 mg/dL.</li>
                <li>Documentation of steroid administration (drug, dose, route, time).</li>
