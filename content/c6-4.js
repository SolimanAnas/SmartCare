            <ul>
                <li><strong>Allergen Exposure History:</strong> Identify recent exposure to potential allergens (foods, medications, insect stings, latex). Confirm history of known allergies or previous anaphylaxis. Check for medical alert bracelets.</li>
                <li><strong>Severity Assessment:</strong> Differentiate mild/moderate allergic reaction (localized hives) from anaphylaxis (systemic involvement of =2 organ systems or hypotension).</li>
                <li><strong>Airway:</strong> Assess for stridor, hoarseness, throat swelling.</li>

                <li><strong>Circulation:</strong> Check for hypotension, tachycardia, poor perfusion.</li>
                <li><strong>Skin/Mucosa:</strong> Urticaria, angioedema, flushing.</li>
                <li><strong>Gastrointestinal:</strong> Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.</li>

                <li><strong>Moderate Reaction:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Diphenhydramine: Adults 25-50 mg IV/IM/PO; Pediatrics 1 mg/kg (max 50 mg).</li>
                        <li>Hydrocortisone: Adults 100-200 mg IV/IM; Pediatrics 2 mg/kg (max 200 mg).</li>

                                <li>Adults: 0.3-0.5 mg IM (1:1000) in anterolateral thigh. Repeat every 5-15 minutes as needed.</li>
                                <li>Pediatrics: 0.01 mg/kg IM (max 0.3 mg). Use pediatric EpiPen if available.</li>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Airway edema can progress rapidly; have a low threshold for IM adrenaline.</li>
                <li>Invasive airway management may be required if symptoms do not resolve.</li>
                <li>Use caution with epinephrine in patients with known cardiovascular disease; consult Telemedicine if needed.</li>
                <li>Elderly patients may present atypically (e.g., hypotension without skin symptoms).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis; do not delay.</li>
                <li>Hydrocortisone should be given after epinephrine.</li>
                <li>All patients who have received epinephrine or have severe reactions must be transported to hospital.</li>
                <li>Notify Dispatch 2 of patients with significant airway edema or poor response to treatment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Allergen exposure, symptom onset and progression.</li>
                <li>Vital signs, SpO2, airway/respiratory/cardiovascular status.</li>
                <li>Medications given: dose, route, time, response.</li>
                <li>IV fluids, oxygen therapy.</li>
                <li>Hospital notification and transport details.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Administer adrenaline for anaphylaxis within 5 minutes of recognition.</li>
            </ul>
