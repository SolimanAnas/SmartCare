            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapidly identify and initiate high‑quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for adults in cardiac arrest.</li>
                <li>Ensure ALS back‑up is requested promptly.</li>
                <li>Rapidly apply an AED (if available) and deliver a shock when indicated.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cardiac arrest confirmation:</strong> Verify unresponsiveness (AVPU: U), absent pulse (carotid) for 5‑10 seconds, absent normal breathing or only agonal gasps.</li>
                <li><strong>Scene and bystander assessment:</strong> Ensure scene safety; determine if bystander CPR was initiated and its quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Triage category:</strong> All unconscious patients and patients in cardiac arrest are Red Priority.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check responsiveness</strong> – tap and shout.</li>
                <li><strong>Call for ALS back‑up</strong> – as soon as arrest is recognised.</li>
                <li><strong>Retrieve emergency equipment</strong> – first rescuer stays with patient, second retrieves AED and other gear.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary survey (C‑A‑B):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>C – Circulation:</strong> Start chest compressions immediately if no pulse felt within 10 seconds.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Rate: 100‑120/min.</li>

                                <li>Minimise interruptions (<10 seconds).</li>
                                <li>Rotate compressors every 2 minutes.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>A – Airway:</strong> Open airway (head‑tilt/chin‑lift; jaw thrust if trauma suspected). Use OPA/NPA as needed. For patients with laryngectomy/tracheostomy, remove obstructions and ventilate via stoma.</li>
                        <li><strong>B – Breathing:</strong> Provide ventilations:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Without advanced airway: 30 compressions : 2 breaths.</li>
                                <li>With advanced airway (supraglottic/ETT): 1 breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths/min), no pause in compressions.</li>
                                <li>Use BVM with 100% oxygen as soon as available.</li>
                                <li>Avoid excessive ventilation.</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Apply AED</strong> – as soon as available.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If shock advised: deliver 1 shock, immediately resume CPR for 2 minutes.</li>
                        <li>If no shock advised: resume CPR for 2 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Continue CPR</strong> – until ALS back‑up arrives or signs of ROSC.</li>
                <li><strong>Check for ROSC</strong> – every 2 minutes (spontaneous pulse, normal breathing, EtCO₂ >40 mmHg).</li>
