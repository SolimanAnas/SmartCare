            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Promptly initiate high‑quality CPR for patients in cardiac arrest.</li>
                <li>Make informed decisions about stopping or transferring CPR based on clinical criteria and futility to avoid unnecessary prolongation of resuscitation.</li>
                <li>Maintain effective CPR during transfer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients presenting with cardiac arrest, including unresponsiveness with no signs of life (no pulse, no breathing, or agonal gasps).</li>
                <li>Patients requiring decisions about initiating, continuing, or terminating CPR.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>None noted.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cardiac arrest confirmation:</strong> Verify unresponsiveness (AVPU: U), absent pulse (carotid/femoral) for 5‑10 seconds, absent normal breathing or only agonal gasps.</li>
                <li><strong>Bystander CPR:</strong> Note presence/absence and quality of bystander CPR.</li>
                <li><strong>Cardiac rhythm:</strong> Apply monitor to identify rhythm (VF/VT/PEA/asystole).</li>
                <li><strong>Time patient last seen alive:</strong> Note time of arrest onset or when patient was last seen alive.</li>
                <li><strong>Signs of irreversible death:</strong> Assess for decomposition, rigor mortis, dependent lividity (hypostasis), incineration, decapitation, injuries totally incompatible with life.</li>
                <li><strong>Futile resuscitation in trauma assessment:</strong> In unwitnessed traumatic cardiac arrest, assess for: blunt or penetrating trauma, no spontaneous movement, no pupillary response, apnoeic and pulseless, ECG shows no organized rhythm – if ALL present, CPR not indicated.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Starting CPR:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CPR does not need to be started if any sign of irreversible death is present.</li>
                        <li>In unwitnessed traumatic arrest, if ALL futility criteria met, do not start CPR.</li>
                        <li>CPR should be started on all other patients.</li>
                        <li>Once started, CPR should generally be continued for at least 20 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Transferring CPR:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mandatory transfer with ongoing CPR for: age <18 years, drowning, hypothermia, pregnancy, clearly identified reversible cause that cannot be corrected prehospitally.</li>
                        <li>Initial resuscitation efforts (airway, BVM, IV access, medications) should be performed prior to transport when feasible.</li>
                        <li>Transport should be prioritised if hospital arrival will provide clear benefit (e.g., haemorrhage control).</li>
                        <li>If family requests transfer, it is appropriate to transport.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Stopping CPR:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only Paramedic, Advanced Paramedic, or Emergency Physician may stop resuscitation efforts. EMTs cannot stop CPR – must transfer or wait for ALS.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stopping CPR in non‑trauma patient:</strong> May stop if ALL of the following are met:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Patient not in mandatory transfer criteria (age <18, drowning, hypothermia, pregnancy, reversible cause).</li>
                                <li>No pulse, no respirations.</li>
                                <li>Appropriate ALS interventions administered.</li>
                                <li>No ROSC after 20 minutes of resuscitation.</li>
                                <li>Rhythm asystole.</li>
                                <li>EtCO₂ <20 mmHg.</li>
                                <li>No heart sounds, no palpable pulse, no neurological function (non‑reactive pupils, no response to pain, no movement).</li>
                                <li>All clinicians agree.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Stopping CPR in trauma patient:</strong> Under normal circumstances, transfer with ongoing CPR is preferred; may stop only in exceptional circumstances (e.g., difficult extrication) if same criteria as above are met.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If any doubt about starting CPR, start CPR.</li>
                <li>Transport should be prioritised when fast arrival at hospital provides clear benefit (e.g., exsanguination).</li>
                <li>ALS back‑up should be routinely requested for all patients undergoing CPR.</li>
                <li>If transferring under CPR, effective resuscitation must be maintained during extrication and transport (chest compressions, airway, ventilation, medications).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In most cases, appropriate initial resuscitation should be performed on‑scene before starting transfer (airway management, BVM, chest compressions, defibrillation, IV access, medications, reversal of identified causes).</li>
                <li>If it is difficult to perform some procedures (e.g., IV access) prior to transfer, a clinical decision must balance time taken vs. ability to perform en route.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification, mechanism/medical complaint, injuries/information, signs (rhythm, EtCO₂, response to CPR, ROSC signs).</li>
                <li>Treatment: time CPR started/stopped, defibrillation, medications, ventilation method, airway management, transfer decision rationale.</li>
                <li>Allergies, medications, background, other (scene conditions, staff involved, consensus notes for stopping CPR).</li>
                <li>Ensure accurate time‑stamping of key actions.</li>
                <li>If CPR stopped, include signs of irreversible death or futility criteria met.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure all relevant information surrounding the decision to start/stop or transfer CPR is captured in the patient care report.</li>
            </ul>
