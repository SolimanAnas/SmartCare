            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Terminate active seizures or prevent recurrence in the prehospital setting to protect the patient from injury and hypoxia.</li>
                <li>Ensure safe transport to an appropriate medical facility for further evaluation and management of underlying causes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients presenting with seizures or post‑ictal states, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Active generalized tonic‑clonic seizures (e.g., convulsions, rhythmic jerking).</li>
                        <li>Focal seizures (e.g., localized twitching, sensory disturbances).</li>
                        <li>Status epilepticus (seizures lasting >5 minutes or recurrent without recovery).</li>
                        <li>Post‑ictal state (e.g., confusion, lethargy, or weakness following a seizure).</li>
                        <li>History of epilepsy, recent seizure activity, or precipitating factors (e.g., medication non‑compliance, fever, or trauma).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients without history or description of seizure activity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Seizure characteristics:</strong> Confirm active seizure activity (tonic‑clonic, focal), duration, frequency, pattern (single, recurrent, status epilepticus).</li>
                <li><strong>Seizure history:</strong> History of epilepsy, anticonvulsant use, precipitating factors (missed meds, sleep deprivation, fever, alcohol withdrawal, head trauma). Check for medical alert bracelets.</li>
                <li><strong>Post‑ictal assessment:</strong> Evaluate for confusion, lethargy, focal deficits, injuries sustained during seizure (tongue biting, head trauma, fractures).</li>
                <li><strong>Glucose assessment:</strong> Check random blood sugar (RBS) to rule out hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL), which can trigger seizures or mimic seizure activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Non‑epileptic causes:</strong> Consider meningitis, head injury, hypoglycemia, eclampsia, pyrexia, poisons, alcohol, drug withdrawal.</li>
                <li><strong>Triage category:</strong> Red priority: ongoing active seizures, status epilepticus.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary survey:</strong> As per Universal Care CPG. Administer oxygen to maintain SpO₂ ≥94%.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider red flags:</strong> Status epilepticus (>5 min or recurrent without recovery), respiratory depression/hypoxia, suspected head trauma, first‑time seizure, pregnancy with seizures.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back‑up:</strong> Routinely for active seizures; early benzodiazepines improve outcomes; meet ALS en route.</li>
                <li><strong>Active seizure management:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protect patient: remove hazards, pad surroundings, avoid restraining movements.</li>
                        <li>Position in recovery position post‑seizure to protect airway.</li>
                        <li>Suction oral secretions/vomit to maintain airway patency.</li>
                        <li>Use nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airway if needed in unresponsive patients.</li>
                        <li>Establish IV access for active seizures, status epilepticus, or anticipated medication.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Medication administration:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Midazolam:</strong> Adults: IM 10 mg (single dose, do not repeat), IV 5 mg (repeat once after 5‑10 min, max 10 mg). Pediatrics: IM 0.2 mg/kg (max 10 mg), repeat once after 10‑20 min; IV 0.1 mg/kg (max 5 mg), repeat once after 10‑20 min.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diazepam:</strong> Adults: IV 5 mg (repeat once after 5 min, max 10 mg). Pediatrics: IV 0.1 mg/kg (max 5 mg), repeat once after 5 min; PR 0.5 mg/kg (max 5 mg), repeat once after 5 min.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Post‑seizure/post‑ictal management:</strong> Recovery position, oxygen, basic airway adjuncts if needed. Advanced airways rarely required unless airway compromise persists.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient reassessment:</strong> Continuous monitoring of vital signs, level of consciousness, and for recurrence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>ALS back‑up routinely requested for active seizures; meet en route.</li>
                <li>Check blood glucose prior to benzodiazepine administration.</li>
                <li>Diazepam IM not recommended (slow onset); use IM midazolam.</li>
                <li>Pediatric febrile seizures: consider in children <5 years; assess for fever and infection.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification, mechanism/medical complaint (seizure characteristics, duration), injuries/information (trauma, medication history).</li>
                <li>Signs: GCS/AVPU, post‑ictal findings, vital signs, pupil response, glucose level.</li>
                <li>Treatment: time seizure started/stopped, benzodiazepines (type, route, dose, time), airway interventions, oxygen.</li>
                <li>Allergies, medications (home AEDs, last dose), background (epilepsy history, comorbidities), other (scene safety, witness account, ALS coordination).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Administer benzodiazepines for all patients in status epilepticus.</li>
                <li>Request ALS back‑up for all patients with active seizures.</li>
                <li>Perform an RBS for all seizure patients.</li>
