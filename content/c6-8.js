            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapidly identify and manage hypoglycemia to prevent neurological injury.</li>
                <li>Restore blood glucose levels to a safe range.</li>
                <li>Prevent hypoglycemia recurrence and ensure appropriate disposition.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Confusion, irritability, sweating, shakiness, seizures, or unresponsiveness.</li>
                        <li>Random blood sugar (RBS) <70 mg/dL.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hyperglycemia without hypoglycemic symptoms.</li>
                <li>Altered mental status or symptoms clearly attributable to another cause (e.g., stroke, trauma, drug overdose) without glucose abnormality.</li>
                <li>Patients with normal blood glucose levels and no clinical suspicion of glycemic disturbance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Glucose Measurement:</strong> Check RBS to confirm hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL). Repeat after interventions to monitor response.</li>
                <li><strong>History Specific to Glycemic Disorders:</strong> Confirm history of diabetes (type 1 or type 2), insulin use, or oral hypoglycemic agents. Inquire about recent medication compliance (e.g., excess hypoglycemic agents). Identify precipitating factors (infection, stress, dietary changes).</li>
                <li><strong>Symptoms of Hypoglycemia:</strong> Autonomic symptoms (sweating, tremors, anxiety, palpitations). Neurological symptoms (confusion, irritability, seizures, coma).</li>
                <li><strong>Determine Triage Category:</strong> Red priority for severe hypoglycemia with seizures, unresponsiveness, or hypotension.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary and Secondary Surveys:</strong> Perform as per Universal Care CPG. Unconscious patients should be placed in the recovery position while treatment is administered.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen:</strong> Consider oxygen if symptoms of hypoxia or respiratory distress; titrate to maintain SpO2 =94%.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back-up:</strong> For severe hypoglycemia with seizures, unresponsiveness, or hypotension.</li>
                <li><strong>Establish IV Access:</strong> For administration of IV dextrose or fluids. Consider IO access if IV unsuccessful and patient is critical. Avoid fluids in uncomplicated hypoglycemia unless hypotension is present.</li>
                <li><strong>Dextrose 10%:</strong> Adults: 100-200 mL IV (10-20 g), repeat as needed if RBS remains <70 mg/dL. Pediatrics: 2-4 mL/kg IV (0.2-0.4 g/kg, max 25 g).</li>
                <li><strong>Glucose 40% Oral Paste:</strong> Adults: 15-20 g orally if conscious and able to swallow. Pediatrics: 0.5-1 g/kg orally (max 15 g).</li>
                <li><strong>Glucagon:</strong> Indicated if IV access is unavailable and patient is unresponsive. Adults: 1 mg IM (once only). Pediatrics: 0.5 mg IM (<20 kg) or 1 mg (=20 kg), once only.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Reassessment:</strong> Recheck RBS after each intervention. Frequently reassess mental status and vital signs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure airway is secure before administering oral glucose.</li>
                <li>Monitor closely for seizures or vomiting.</li>
                <li>Reassess blood glucose after treatment to ensure response.</li>
                <li>Document all treatment and timing of reassessment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rule out alternative causes of altered mental status such as stroke, head trauma, or overdose.</li>
                <li>Consider hypoglycemia as a secondary complication in seizure patients.</li>
                <li>If family or caregivers administered treatment prior to EMS arrival, confirm substance and dose.</li>
                <li>Patients with repeated hypoglycemia should be advised to follow up with their diabetes care provider.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre- and post-treatment RBS, vital signs, AVPU/GCS.</li>
                <li>Diabetes history, medications, precipitating factors.</li>
                <li>Treatment given (oral glucose, IV dextrose, glucagon), dose, route, response.</li>
                <li>Transport decision and hospital notification.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Perform and document RBS before and after treatment.</li>
                <li>Administer glucose (as appropriate) for all patients with an RBS <70 mg/dL.</li>
