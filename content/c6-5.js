            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients presenting with altered mental status, including:
                    <ul>

                </li>
                <li>Suspected underlying causes such as hypoglycemia, hypoxia, stroke, overdose, infection, or trauma.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>None noted.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neurological Status:</strong> Evaluate level of consciousness using AVPU (Alert, Verbal, Painful, Unresponsive) or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Assess for focal neurological deficits (unequal pupils, motor weakness, speech impairment). Note behavioral changes (agitation, combativeness, lethargy).</li>
                <li><strong>History:</strong> Identify potential causes through SAMPLE history: recent events (trauma, drug use, medication changes), medical history (diabetes, epilepsy, stroke, psychiatric disorders), medication use (insulin, sedatives, missed doses). Check for medical alert bracelets.</li>
                <li><strong>Differential Diagnosis (AEIOU TIPS):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A � Alcohol, Abuse, Atypical migraine</li>
                        <li>E � Epilepsy, Electrolytes</li>
                        <li>I � Insulin (hypoglycemia)</li>
                        <li>O � Oxygen, Overdose</li>
                        <li>U � Uremia (kidney failure)</li>
                        <li>T � Trauma, Tumor</li>
                        <li>I � Infection</li>
                        <li>P � Psych, Poisoning</li>
                        <li>S � Seizure, Subarachnoid hemorrhage, Sepsis</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Glucose and Oxygen Assessment:</strong> Check random blood sugar (RBS) to identify hypoglycemia (&lt;70 mg/dL) or hyperglycemia (&gt;200 mg/dL). Assess for hypoxia via pulse oximetry (SpO2 &lt;94%).</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental and Toxicological Clues:</strong> Look for evidence of drug or alcohol use (pill bottles, drug paraphernalia). Assess for environmental exposures (carbon monoxide, chemicals).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary and Secondary Surveys:</strong> Perform as per Universal Care CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back-up:</strong> For patients with GCS &lt;13, seizures, or significant cardiovascular compromise.</li>
                <li><strong>Red Flags:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unresponsiveness or coma (AVPU).</li>
                        <li>Hypoglycemia (RBS &lt;70 mg/dL) ? go to Hypoglycemia CPG.</li>
                        <li>Severe hyperglycemia (RBS &gt;400 mg/dL) ? go to Hyperglycemia CPG.</li>
                        <li>Hypoxia (SpO2 &lt;90%) or respiratory distress.</li>
                        <li>Suspected stroke (focal neurological deficits, sudden onset) ? go to Stroke CPG.</li>
                        <li>Signs of overdose (pinpoint pupils, respiratory depression) ? go to Overdose CPG.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Evaluate for Signs of Shock or Instability:</strong> Hypotension (SBP &lt;90 mmHg in adults, or age-specific for pediatrics), tachycardia, or poor perfusion (cool, clammy skin, delayed capillary refill &gt;2 seconds). If shock present, initiate fluid resuscitation and address underlying causes. Manage shock as per appropriate Shock Guideline.</li>
                <li><strong>Establish IV Access:</strong> For hypotension, suspected hypoglycemia, or anticipated medication administration. Consider IO access if IV access cannot be obtained.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen Therapy:</strong> Administer oxygen to maintain SpO2 =94% if hypoxic.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Reassessment:</strong> Frequently reassess neurological status (AVPU/GCS) every 5-15 minutes depending on triage category.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>It is difficult to accurately assess patients with an altered mental status. All patients with altered mental status should be transported to hospital.</li>
                <li>Protect the airway and be prepared for vomiting or aspiration.</li>
                <li>If patient is agitated, consider sedation only if necessary for safety (see Abnormal Behavior CPG).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hypoglycemia is a common and reversible cause; always check blood glucose.</li>
                <li>Consider naloxone for suspected opioid overdose (pinpoint pupils, respiratory depression).</li>
                <li>Elderly patients may present with subtle changes (e.g., lethargy, infection) without fever.</li>
                <li>Pediatric patients: consider fever, infection, ingestion, or trauma.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Neurological status (GCS/AVPU), pupil size/reactivity, vital signs, RBS.</li>
                <li>Possible underlying cause identified (e.g., hypoglycemia, overdose).</li>
                <li>Interventions performed (oxygen, IV fluids, glucose, naloxone, sedation).</li>
                <li>Response to treatment and changes in mental status.</li>
                <li>Hospital notification and transport details.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Perform and document an RBS on all patients with altered mental status.</li>
                <li>Assess and document the initial AVPU or GCS score.</li>
