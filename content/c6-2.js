                <li>Maximizing and maintaining safety for the patient, EMS personnel, and others.</li>
                <li>Ensure appropriate pharmacological management when indicated.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients presenting with abnormal or unusual behavior who are a danger to themselves or others.</li>

                <li>Patients with abnormal behavior secondary to medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury or hypoxia (address underlying cause first).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secondary survey:</strong> Once patient compliance is gained, obtain history and physical examination to exclude reversible causes as per Universal Care CPG (vital signs, blood glucose).</li>
                <li><strong>Investigation of alternative causes:</strong> Consider hypoglycemia, hypoxia, head injury, intoxication, withdrawal, infection, psychiatric illness.</li>
                <li><strong>Sedation Assessment Tool (SAT):</strong> Use to guide patient management and communication (see table). Scoring: +3 (combative, violent), +2 (very anxious/agitated, loud outbursts), +1 (anxious/restless), 0 (awake and calm), -1 (asleep but rouses), -2 (responds to physical stimulation), -3 (no response).</li>
                <li><strong>Determine triage category:</strong> Per Patient Triage Categories CPG.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary and secondary survey:</strong> As per Universal Care CPG. May need to delay until patient compliant.</li>
                <li><strong>Attempt verbal de‑escalation:</strong>

                        <li>Introduce yourself, state you are there to help.</li>
                        <li>Use short, simple messages; repetition is key.</li>
                        <li>Limit unnecessary noise (radios, lights, sirens).</li>
                        <li>Try to establish rapport.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Goal: Achieve SAT score of 0 to -1 to gain compliance and facilitate safe transfer.</li>
                        <li>Medication selection based on SAT score (see table).</li>

                        <li>Consider oxygen (nasal cannula) for SAT -1 or less.</li>
                        <li>Establish IV access as soon as possible.</li>
                        <li>Position sedated patients with altered mental status in recovery position.</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Patient positioning:</strong> Stretcher in sitting position reduces aspiration risk and patient's physical strength. Do not place prone.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All sedatives carry risk of respiratory depression, apnea, hypotension.</li>
                <li>Patients receiving multiple doses or multiple medications have increased risk of adverse events; may require airway management.</li>
                <li>Work with police to reposition restrained patients to ensure airway, breathing, and circulation are not impaired.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Verbal de‑escalation is under‑utilized; attempt before pharmacological intervention.</li>
                <li>All patients who have received sedation must be transported to hospital.</li>
                <li>Haloperidol may take up to 20 minutes to take effect; may not work in some patients.</li>
                <li>Benzodiazepines are preferred for alcohol withdrawal; haloperidol for psychiatric agitation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification, mechanism/medical complaint, injuries/information (physical injuries, psychiatric history), signs (GCS, vital signs, blood glucose, SAT score).</li>
                <li>Treatment: verbal de‑escalation methods, sedation (drug, dose, route, response), physical restraint (indication, duration, staff).</li>
                <li>Allergies, medications, background (mental health history, recent events), other (police involvement, caregiver input).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>When sedation is administered, ensure documentation of the medication name, dose, and effect.</li>
            </ul>
