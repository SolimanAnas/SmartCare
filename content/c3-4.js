            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Stabilize patients presenting with pulmonary edema.</li>
                <li>Enhance oxygenation and ventilation.</li>
                <li>Provide CPAP to moderate and severe cases.</li>
                <li>Identify and address underlying causes (e.g., ACS, fluid overload).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <p>Patients with a provisional diagnosis of pulmonary edema.</p>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <p>Difficulty of breathing secondary to another cause (e.g., asthma, COPD).</p>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Respiratory assessment:</strong> Common signs include dyspnoea on exertion or when lying down, wheezing, coughing, pink sputum/haemoptysis, chest pain, cyanosis/pallor/anxiety, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles on auscultation.</li>
                <li><strong>Severity determination:</strong> Mild, moderate, or severe based on general appearance, respiratory rate, work of breathing, words per breath, air movement, SpO₂.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider alternative causes:</strong> Pneumonia, ARDS.</li>
                <li><strong>Cardiac assessment:</strong> 12‑lead ECG to include or exclude concurrent STEMI or arrhythmia.</li>
                <li><strong>Triage category:</strong> As per Patient Triage Categories CPG. Red priority if severe distress, hypoxia, or haemodynamic instability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back‑up</strong> – for severe cases, or in moderate cases where CPAP is not available.</li>
                <li><strong>Position the patient</strong> – seated with head and torso elevated as much as possible; feet and legs dependent.</li>
                <li><strong>Administer oxygen</strong> – titrate to maintain SpO₂ ≥92%.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider Tele‑EMS consultation</strong> – if diagnosis unclear or to confirm CPAP settings.</li>
                <li><strong>GTN (Glyceryl Trinitrate)</strong> – if SBP >100 mmHg: 0.4 mg SL every 5 minutes (max 3 doses).</li>
                <li><strong>CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure)</strong> – initiate if SpO₂ <90% on room air or obvious respiratory distress. Start at 5 cmH₂O and increase as tolerated. Provide reassurance; do not remove mask for oral medications if good seal is achieved.</li>
                <li><strong>BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure)</strong> – if inspiratory support is required: IPAP 10 cmH₂O, EPAP 5–10 cmH₂O.</li>
                <li><strong>Furosemide</strong> – only for patients with signs of fluid overload. Dose: 40 mg IV/IO. Routine administration is not recommended.</li>
                <li><strong>Salbutamol</strong> – if CPAP is available, administer nebulized salbutamol via the CPAP mask. If no CPAP, a single dose of 5 mg nebulized may be given; repeat after 10–15 minutes only if respiratory function improves. If no improvement, no further doses.</li>
                <li><strong>If cardiac chest pain or STEMI</strong> – treat as per Chest Pain / ACS CPG.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Monitor for signs of fluid overload before administering furosemide.</li>
                <li>Request ALS back‑up for moderate, severe, or deteriorating patients.</li>
                <li>Ensure proper mask fit for CPAP/BiPAP; coach the patient to reduce claustrophobia.</li>
                <li>Avoid removing CPAP mask for oral medications if a good seal is achieved.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Attaining a proper mask fit is key to effective pressure delivery.</li>
                <li>Consider starting with a lower pressure (5 cmH₂O) and increase as the patient becomes comfortable.</li>
                <li>Do not delay transport in severe cases; continue CPAP en route.</li>
                <li>Salbutamol should be given via CPAP mask if possible to ensure delivery.</li>
                <li>Furosemide should be reserved for definite fluid overload; avoid in hypovolaemic patients.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification, mechanism (suspected cause), injuries/illness, signs (cyanosis, crackles), vital signs, SpO₂, ECG findings.</li>
                <li>Treatment: oxygen, GTN doses, CPAP/BiPAP use, furosemide, salbutamol, response to interventions.</li>
                <li>Allergies, medications, background, other (e.g., Tele‑EMS consultation).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Apply CPAP/BiPAP for all severe pulmonary edema patients.</li>
            </ul>

            correct: 2,
            explanation: "Hypotension in pulmonary edema may indicate cardiogenic shock. GTN is contraindicated. Cautious fluid may help if hypovolaemic, but often inotropes/pressors are needed. CPAP may still be used but monitor BP closely."

            q: "Why is CPAP effective in pulmonary edema?",
            options: ["Increases preload", "Decreases intrathoracic pressure", "Increases alveolar pressure, reducing transudation", "Stimulates diuresis"],
            correct: 2,
            explanation: "CPAP increases alveolar pressure, opposing hydrostatic pressure and reducing fluid transudation into alveoli. It also reduces preload and afterload."

            correct: 2,
            explanation: "Pleuritic chest pain is more typical of pericarditis or pulmonary embolism; pulmonary edema usually presents with dull, retrosternal discomfort or no pain."

            q: "A patient with known renal failure presents with pulmonary edema. What medication should be used with caution?",
            options: ["GTN", "Furosemide", "Salbutamol", "CPAP"],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Furosemide may be less effective in renal failure and can cause ototoxicity; use cautiously and monitor response."

        {
            q: "What is the mechanism of action of GTN in pulmonary edema?",
            options: ["Positive inotropy", "Vasodilation (reduces preload and afterload)", "Bronchodilation", "Diuresis"],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "GTN dilates veins (reducing preload) and arteries (reducing afterload), decreasing the workload of the heart and pulmonary congestion."

            correct: 2,
            explanation: "Agitation is often due to claustrophobia or discomfort. Reassure, check fit, and consider lowering pressure temporarily. Sedation may be needed but only after non‑pharmacological measures."
