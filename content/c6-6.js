            <h3 style="color:var(--primary-accent);">?? Epistaxis (Nosebleed)</h3>
            
            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Control acute epistaxis to prevent airway compromise or significant blood loss.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients presenting with epistaxis (nosebleed), including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Active nasal bleeding, unilateral or bilateral.</li>
                        <li>Mild, self-limiting bleeding to severe, persistent hemorrhage.</li>
                        <li>Associated symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, or pallor due to blood loss.</li>
                        <li>Suspected underlying causes such as hypertension, trauma, coagulopathy, or medication use (e.g., anticoagulants).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients with no active bleeding or resolved epistaxis prior to arrival.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patient History:</strong> Onset, duration, frequency; triggers (trauma, dry environment); medication use (anticoagulants, antiplatelets, nasal sprays); history of bleeding disorders, hypertension, or recent nasal procedures.</li>
                <li><strong>Bleeding Severity:</strong> Assess the amount (dripping, streaming, clots), site (anterior vs. posterior), and any blood in the oropharynx (posterior bleeding).</li>
                <li><strong>Airway and Swallowing:</strong> Check for blood pooling in the oropharynx, difficulty swallowing, or airway compromise.</li>
                <li><strong>Signs of Shock:</strong> Pallor, tachycardia, hypotension, or altered mental status indicate significant blood loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine Triage Category:</strong> Red priority for uncontrolled bleeding, airway compromise, or signs of shock.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Survey:</strong> Ensure airway patency, breathing, and circulation. If airway is compromised, suction and position appropriately.</li>
                <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Sit the patient upright with head tilted forward to prevent blood from pooling in the oropharynx. Instruct the patient to avoid swallowing blood and not to blow the nose.</li>
                <li><strong>Nasal Compression:</strong> Apply firm, continuous pressure to the soft part of the nose (alae nasi) for 10�15 minutes using a gauze pad or cloth.</li>
                <li><strong>Nasal Packing:</strong> If bleeding persists, consider nasal packing with hemostatic agents or gauze. Posterior packing requires hospital management.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back-up:</strong> For uncontrolled bleeding, signs of shock, or airway compromise. Prioritize transport; meet ALS en route.</li>
                <li><strong>IV Access and Fluid Resuscitation:</strong> For hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg in adults) or tachycardia >120 bpm, administer 500 mL bolus of normal saline (adults) or 20 mL/kg (pediatrics) as per shock protocol.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Reassessment:</strong> Reassess bleeding every 5�10 minutes; maintain direct pressure if bleeding continues. Monitor for airway compromise or worsening blood loss.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid delays in transport for patients with red flags (e.g., posterior epistaxis, significant airway).</li>
                <li>If initial attempts to stop bleeding fail, prioritize rapid transfer to hospital.</li>
                <li>Patients on anticoagulants are at higher risk; treat aggressively and transport.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Anterior bleeding is usually from Kiesselbach�s plexus; posterior bleeding often requires otolaryngology intervention.</li>
                <li>Epistaxis with uncontrolled bleeding may result in severe hypovolemic shock.</li>
                <li>Ice packs applied to the bridge of the nose may help vasoconstriction (adjunctive).</li>
                <li>Hypertension may exacerbate bleeding but should not be treated emergently unless severe and causing end-organ damage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Onset, duration, estimated blood loss, site of bleeding (anterior/posterior).</li>
                <li>Medications (anticoagulants, antiplatelets), history of bleeding disorders, trauma.</li>
                <li>Vital signs, signs of airway compromise.</li>
                <li>Interventions: nasal compression, packing, IV fluids, response.</li>
                <li>Transport decision and hospital notification.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Document all bleeding control measures.</li>
