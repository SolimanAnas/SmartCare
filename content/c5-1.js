            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapidly identify suspected acute stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) to facilitate time‑sensitive transfer.</li>
                <li>Minimize secondary brain injury through supportive care.</li>
                <li>Ensure rapid transport to a stroke‑capable medical facility for definitive evaluation and treatment within the therapeutic window.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute stroke or TIA, including sudden onset of focal neurological deficits (e.g., weakness, numbness, or paralysis of face, arm, or leg).</li>
                <li>Speech difficulties (e.g., slurred speech, aphasia, or inability to speak).</li>
                <li>Vision changes (e.g., sudden loss of vision, double vision).</li>
                <li>Dizziness, loss of balance, or coordination problems.</li>
                <li>Severe headache with no known cause (e.g., suggestive of hemorrhagic stroke).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Symptoms clearly attributable to another cause (e.g., hypoglycemia, seizure, or trauma) without stroke‑like features.</li>
                <li>Patients with resolved symptoms and no ongoing neurological deficits (e.g., prior TIA with no new symptoms).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stroke screening:</strong> Perform a 'BEFAST' assessment: Balance (sudden loss), Eyes (vision loss), Face (droop), Arms (drift), Speech (slurred), Time (last known well).</li>
                <li><strong>Neurological deficit assessment:</strong> Identify focal neurological signs, gaze deviation, pupil asymmetry, facial paralysis. Use AVPU or GCS to quantify level of consciousness.</li>
                <li><strong>Time of onset:</strong> Confirm the precise time symptoms began or when the patient was last known well (critical for thrombolytic or endovascular therapy eligibility).</li>
                <li><strong>Glucose assessment:</strong> Check random blood sugar (RBS) to rule out hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) or hyperglycemia (>400 mg/dL), which can mimic stroke symptoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Stroke mimics:</strong> Consider intracerebral lesions (tumor, abscess), seizures/post‑ictal states (Todd's paralysis), hemiplegic migraine, electrolyte abnormalities, conversion disorder.</li>
                <li><strong>Triage category:</strong> All patients with signs of acute stroke are Red Priority.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary & secondary survey:</strong> As per Universal Care CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back‑up:</strong> As per Universal Care CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient positioning:</strong> Semi‑recumbent or with head elevated 15‑30° if alert.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen:</strong> Administer to maintain SpO₂ ≥94% if hypoxia present; avoid routine oxygen in normoxic patients.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider red flags:</strong> Onset within 4.5 hours (thrombolytic window) or up to 24 hours (endovascular window), rapidly deteriorating GCS, signs of increased ICP (unequal pupils, severe headache, vomiting), respiratory distress, suspected hemorrhagic stroke.</li>
                <li><strong>12‑lead ECG:</strong> Perform, but do not delay transfer; can be done en route.</li>
                <li><strong>IV access:</strong> Establish if needed; large bore (18g or larger) preferred for contrast CT, but do not delay scene time.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood pressure management:</strong> Do not lower BP unless >220/120 mmHg with signs of end‑organ dysfunction (consult Tele‑EMS).</li>
                <li><strong>Patient reassessment:</strong> Frequently reassess per Universal Care CPG (neurological status, GCS).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Time‑sensitive transport: Patients with stroke symptoms and onset <4.5 hours should be rapidly transported to a stroke centre. Communicate clearly with Dispatch.</li>
                <li>Accurate last known well (LKW) time is essential.</li>
                <li>Do not lower blood pressure unless extreme; maintain cerebral perfusion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>BEFAST is more sensitive than FAST alone.</li>
                <li>Patients with resolving symptoms may still be candidates for treatment; transport.</li>
                <li>If patient is on anticoagulants, note for hospital.</li>
                <li>Consider seizure as a stroke mimic; if post‑ictal, still transport.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification, mechanism/medical complaint (sudden onset, BEFAST findings), injuries/information (stroke mimics ruled out).</li>
                <li>Signs: neurological exam, GCS, pupils, vital signs, RBS.</li>
                <li>Treatment: time of onset/LKW, oxygen, IV access, ECG, stroke alert activation.</li>
                <li>Allergies, medications (especially anticoagulants), background, other (scene findings, witness statements).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Perform and document a BEFAST assessment for all suspected stroke cases.</li>
                <li>Perform an RBS for all patients with suspected stroke.</li>
                <li>Initiate transport for all patients with stroke symptoms <4.5 hours from onset within 15 minutes of EMS arrival.</li>
