            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimize oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamics in patients achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) to support organ perfusion and neurological outcome.</li>
                <li>Implement measures to prevent re‑arrest.</li>
                <li>Ensure rapid transport to a facility capable of advanced post‑cardiac arrest care appropriate to the clinical condition (e.g., STEMI).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Adult and pediatric patients who have achieved ROSC following cardiac arrest, including presence of a palpable pulse.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients with no ROSC, requiring ongoing CPR.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ROSC confirmation:</strong> Verify organized rhythm, palpable pulse (carotid/femoral) for at least 10 seconds. Monitor end‑tidal CO₂ (EtCO₂) – sustained >40 mmHg indicates ROSC.</li>
                <li><strong>Neurological status:</strong> Evaluate AVPU or GCS, assess for focal deficits (pupil asymmetry, motor weakness).</li>
                <li><strong>Hemodynamic stability:</strong> Monitor for hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg), poor perfusion (cool skin, delayed capillary refill >2s).</li>
                <li><strong>12‑lead ECG:</strong> Perform in all medical cardiac arrests to identify potential cardiac cause (e.g., STEMI).</li>
                <li><strong>Re‑arrest risk:</strong> Identify factors increasing risk (persistent arrhythmias, hypoxia, hypotension). Reassess reversible causes (H's and T's).</li>
                <li><strong>Triage category:</strong> All ROSC patients are Red Priority.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back‑up:</strong> Request if not already activated; meet en route.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary survey:</strong> Ensure airway patency, adequate breathing, circulation. Prepare for immediate re‑initiation of CPR if re‑arrest occurs.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary survey:</strong> Focused neurological and hemodynamic assessment. Obtain history from bystanders (cause of arrest, duration, interventions).</li>
                <li><strong>Reassess vital signs:</strong> RR, HR, BP, EtCO₂.</li>
                <li><strong>IV access:</strong> Establish if not already obtained; consider second line if vasopressors anticipated. IO if IV fails.</li>
                <li><strong>12‑lead ECG:</strong> For all medical cardiac arrests; for traumatic arrests only if cardiac involvement suspected.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygenation and ventilation:</strong> Titrate oxygen to maintain SpO₂ 94‑98% (avoid hyperoxia). Provide ventilatory support if inadequate. Target EtCO₂ 35‑45 mmHg.</li>
                <li><strong>Fluid administration:</strong> For hypotension: adults 250‑500 mL bolus IV/IO, pediatrics 10‑20 mL/kg. Repeat cautiously; avoid fluid overload in cardiogenic shock.</li>
                <li><strong>Hemodynamic support:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adrenaline preferred for hypotensive shock (push dose 0.01 mg/kg every 2‑5 min or infusion 0.05‑0.3 mcg/kg/min).</li>
                        <li>Dopamine (5‑20 mcg/kg/min) may be used for normotensive shock.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Arrhythmia management:</strong> Monitor for recurrent VF/VT or bradycardia; prepare for defibrillation or pacing.</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted temperature management (TTM):</strong> Maintain core temperature 32‑36°C. Remove clothing, cool vehicle, avoid active cooling without core temp monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Sedation:</strong> For agitation or intubated patients: midazolam (adults 1‑5 mg IV, pediatrics 0.1 mg/kg), diazepam (adults 1‑5 mg IV, pediatrics 0.1 mg/kg), or ketamine (adults 0.25‑1 mg/kg, pediatrics 0.5‑1 mg/kg). Avoid sedation for supraglottic airway management; remove device if causing agitation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid aggressive fluid boluses in cardiogenic shock (pulmonary edema, JVD).</li>
                <li>Use vasopressors if hypotension persists after fluids.</li>
                <li>Avoid hyper‑/hypoventilation; target EtCO₂ 35‑45 mmHg.</li>
                <li>Monitor for seizures or neurological deterioration; treat as per Seizures CPG.</li>
                <li>Place supraglottic airway for unresponsive patients being transported.</li>
                <li>Avoid rapid/rough movement for up to 10 minutes following ROSC (may cause re‑arrest).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Perform a full reassessment (ABC, vitals) before moving the patient.</li>
                <li>Pediatric arrest often hypoxic – focus on effective ventilations. Intubation may be difficult; supraglottic airway often sufficient.</li>
                <li>After traumatic brain injury, maintain SBP >90 mmHg (adults) or age‑appropriate SBP (pediatrics).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification, mechanism/medical complaint, injuries/information, signs (vital signs, EtCO₂, GCS, ECG).</li>
                <li>Treatment: oxygen, fluids, vasopressors, sedation, TTM, airway management.</li>
                <li>Allergies, medications, background, other (e.g., time of ROSC, ALS contact).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Document a set of vital signs including EtCO₂ within 5 minutes of ROSC.</li>
                <li>Perform a 12‑lead ECG for all non‑traumatic ROSC patients within 5 minutes of ROSC.</li>
