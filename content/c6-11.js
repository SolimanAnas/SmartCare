            <ul>
                <li><strong>Elderly Patients:</strong> Shock may present atypically (e.g., confusion, minimal tachycardia due to beta-blocker use). Use caution with fluid boluses in patients with heart failure; consult Tele-EMS for guidance.</li>
                <li><strong>Fluid Resuscitation:</strong> Avoid over-resuscitation in cardiogenic or obstructive shock; monitor for signs of pulmonary edema (e.g., crackles, dyspnea).</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Hypovolemic: Dehydration, gastrointestinal bleeding, ruptured ectopic pregnancy.</li>
                        <li>Cardiogenic: Myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias.</li>
                        <li>Distributive: Sepsis, anaphylaxis, neurogenic shock (e.g., spinal cord injury).</li>
                        <li>Obstructive: Pulmonary embolism, pericardial tamponade, tension pneumothorax.</li>
