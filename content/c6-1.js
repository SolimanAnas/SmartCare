            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify life‑threatening causes of abdominal pain.</li>
                <li>Improve patient comfort through appropriate pain management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Abdominal pain or discomfort related to a non‑traumatic cause.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Abdominal pain due to trauma.</li>
                <li>Abdominal pain related to pregnancy (see PV Hemorrhage in Pregnancy or Childbirth CPG).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abdominal examination:</strong> Inspect for distension, bruising, visible abnormalities. Palpate for tenderness, rigidity, masses. Note rebound tenderness or guarding.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient history:</strong> Use OPQRST and SAMPLE to identify likely cause. Investigate possibility of pregnancy.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider red flags:</strong> Severe unrelenting pain, fever (>38°C), persistent vomiting or hematemesis, suspected pregnancy complications (ectopic, miscarriage).</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluate for shock or instability:</strong> Hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg), tachycardia, altered mental status, poor perfusion.</li>
                <li><strong>12‑lead ECG:</strong> Consider in patients >40 years or with ≥3 cardiac risk factors (smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, family history).</li>
                <li><strong>Determine triage category:</strong> Per Patient Triage Categories CPG.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary and secondary survey:</strong> As per Universal Care CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back‑up:</strong> As per Universal Care CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Establish IV access:</strong> Indicated for dehydration, hypotension, or anticipated medication.</li>
                <li><strong>Fluid resuscitation:</strong> If signs of shock or dehydration: adults 500‑1000 mL bolus, reassess; pediatrics 20 mL/kg bolus, reassess.</li>
                <li><strong>Pain management:</strong> Assess and manage as per Pain Management CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>If nausea/vomiting present:</strong> Manage as per Nausea & Vomiting CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient reassessment:</strong> Frequently reassess per Universal Care CPG.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Abdominal pain can be a medical emergency poorly detected prehospitally. All patients with non‑specific abdominal pain or persistent vomiting should be recommended to see a doctor.</li>
                <li>Patients with early shock signs, unstable vitals, or suspected serious cause (e.g., appendicitis) should be transported routinely.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Common causes: gastroenteritis, appendicitis, bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, kidney stones, ectopic pregnancy, DKA, mesenteric ischemia.</li>
                <li>Possible alternative causes: myocardial infarction (especially inferior MI), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, AAA.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification, mechanism/medical complaint, injuries/information (relevant history), signs (vital signs, abdominal exam findings), treatment (medications, IV fluids, pain scores), allergies, medications, background, other (ECG findings, pregnancy status).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Assess and document initial and post‑treatment pain score.</li>
            </ul>
