            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain adequate perfusion and identify reversible causes.</li>
                <li>Appropriate management to improve end‑organ perfusion and prevent cardiac arrest.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <p>Adult patients (≥13 years) with heart rate &lt;60 bpm AND symptoms (altered mental status, chest pain, heart failure, syncope, hypotension, shock) or evidence of hemodynamic instability.</p>
            <p>Rhythms include: sinus bradycardia, second‑degree AV block (Mobitz I / II), third‑degree AV block, ventricular escape rhythms.</p>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <p>Paediatric patients (<13 years); bradycardia due to non‑cardiac causes already corrected (e.g., hypoxia, hypothermia).</p>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>12‑lead ECG</strong> – identify rhythm and underlying blocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify reversible causes</strong> – hypoxia, shock, toxins (beta‑blockers, CCB, organophosphates), electrolyte disorders, hypoglycaemia, increased ICP.</li>
                <li><strong>Signs of instability</strong> – hypotension, altered mental status, shock, ischaemic chest discomfort, acute heart failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine triage category</strong> – Red priority if unstable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Management</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary survey</strong> – manage airway as needed (see Airway Management CPG).</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen</strong> – target SpO₂ ≥94%.</li>
                <li><strong>ECG monitoring</strong> – 12‑lead and continuous.</li>
                <li><strong>Check blood glucose</strong> – treat hypoglycaemia (Hypoglycaemia CPG).</li>
                <li><strong>Atropine</strong> – 1 mg IV/IO every 3‑5 minutes (max 3 mg). Caution in myocardial infarction (may increase O₂ demand).</li>
                <li><strong>Transcutaneous pacing</strong> – if atropine ineffective; consider sedation (midazolam 0.5‑1 mg IV or ketamine 0.25‑1 mg/kg).</li>
                <li><strong>Vasopressors</strong> – if pacing fails or unavailable: dopamine 5‑20 mcg/kg/min IV or adrenaline push dose 0.01 mg every 2‑5 minutes / infusion 2‑10 mcg/min.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Before atropine, rule out head injury, hypothermia, hypoxia – bradycardia may be compensatory.</li>
                <li>Atropine may worsen myocardial ischaemia.</li>
                <li>Sedation for pacing: midazolam or ketamine.</li>
                <li>Adrenaline infusion easier than dopamine without syringe driver.</li>
                <li>Transport unstable patients urgently; consider ALS back‑up.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>12‑lead ECG obtained on all bradycardic patients.</li>
                <li>Atropine or transcutaneous pacing administered for all hemodynamically unstable patients (when appropriate).</li>
            </ul>

            correct: 0,
            explanation: "Inferior MI often involves the right ventricle; bradycardia and hypotension may be due to increased vagal tone or RV infarction. Atropine may help, but fluids and pacing may be needed."
