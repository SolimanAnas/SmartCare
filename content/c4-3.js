            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapidly identify and manage adult cardiac arrest to restore spontaneous circulation and oxygenation through high‑quality CPR and advanced life support (ALS) interventions.</li>
                <li>Address reversible causes of cardiac arrest to improve survival and neurological outcomes.</li>
                <li>Ensure seamless coordination with hospital care for post‑arrest management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Adult patients (≥13 years) presenting with cardiac arrest:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unresponsiveness with no signs of life (no pulse, no breathing, or agonal gasps).</li>
                        <li>ECG or AED rhythms indicating ventricular fibrillation (VF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), or asystole.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Patients requiring immediate CPR, defibrillation, and ALS interventions to achieve ROSC.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients with obvious signs of irreversible death (rigor mortis, dependent lividity, decapitation).</li>
                <li>Pediatric patients (<13 years) – see Pediatric Cardiac Arrest CPG.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cardiac arrest confirmation:</strong> Verify unresponsiveness (AVPU: U), absent pulse (carotid or femoral) for 5‑10 seconds, absent normal breathing or only agonal gasps.</li>
                <li><strong>Rhythm assessment:</strong> Apply monitor/defibrillator to identify shockable (VF/VT) vs. non‑shockable (PEA/asystole) rhythms; reassess every 2 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Reversible cause identification (H's and T's):</strong> Hypovolemia, Hypoxia, Hydrogen ion (acidosis), Hypo‑/Hyperkalemia, Hypothermia, Tension pneumothorax, Tamponade, Toxins, Thrombosis (pulmonary/coronary).</li>
                <li><strong>ROSC and post‑arrest monitoring:</strong> Check for signs of ROSC (spontaneous pulse, normal breathing, EtCO₂ >40 mmHg) every 2 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Triage category:</strong> All cardiac arrest patients are Red Priority.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary survey (C‑A‑B):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Chest compressions:</strong> Initiate high‑quality compressions (100‑120/min, 5‑6 cm depth, full recoil) immediately. Rotate compressors every 2 minutes. Minimise interruptions (<10 seconds). Mechanical CPR devices may be used if available, but do not delay defibrillation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Airway:</strong> Use OPA/NPA. Supraglottic airway (laryngeal tube) is preferred over OPA/NPA if available. Patients being transferred under CPR should have a supraglottic airway in place. Intubation may be performed if team is briefed to minimise interruptions and first‑attempt success is likely; use waveform capnography (EtCO₂) to confirm placement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Breathing:</strong> With OPA/NPA: 30:2 ventilation. With advanced airway: 1 breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths/min), no pause in compressions. Avoid hyperventilation. Administer 100% oxygen.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>IV/IO access:</strong> For medication administration or fluid resuscitation. Consider IO if IV cannot be obtained.</li>
                <li><strong>Defibrillation:</strong> Deliver first shock for VF/VT as soon as defibrillator is ready. Resume CPR immediately after shock (<10 seconds interruption). Subsequent shocks every 2 minutes. Use manufacturer‑recommended energy (e.g., Lifepak 15: 200 J, 300 J, 360 J; Zoll X‑Series: 120 J, 150 J, 200 J).</li>
                <li><strong>Waveform capnography:</strong> Use EtCO₂ to monitor CPR quality (target >10 mmHg) and detect ROSC (>40 mmHg).</li>
                <li><strong>Medication administration:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Adrenaline:</strong> 1 mg IV/IO every 3‑5 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Amiodarone:</strong> 1st dose: 300 mg IV/IO after 3rd shock; 2nd dose: 150 mg after 5th shock.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Secondary survey:</strong> Assess for reversible causes during CPR using "5H's and 5T's".</li>
                <li><strong>Consider red flags:</strong> Persistent shockable rhythm after multiple shocks and antiarrhythmics, suspected irreversible causes, unsafe scene.</li>
                <li><strong>Reassess for ROSC</strong> – every 2 minutes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Special Circumstances</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Left lateral uterine displacement, chest compressions higher on sternum, peri‑mortem caesarean delivery for >20 weeks gestation.</li>
                <li><strong>Hypothermia:</strong> Withhold adrenaline until core temperature >30°C; if given, extend intervals. Defibrillation doses unchanged. All hypothermic arrest patients must be transported under CPR.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of manual mode:</strong> Advanced providers may use manual mode to minimise interruptions, but a dedicated person must track rhythm check timing.</li>
                <li><strong>Ventilator use:</strong> Acceptable if within scope; see Invasive Ventilation CPG.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimise interruptions (<10 seconds for rhythm checks, shocks, or ventilations).</li>
                <li>Ensure correct compression depth, rate, and full recoil.</li>
                <li>Use EtCO₂ or feedback devices to optimise CPR quality.</li>
                <li>Ensure no one touches the patient during defibrillation.</li>
                <li>Remove patient from wet surfaces before defibrillation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Time CPR started, AED applied, defibrillation (energy, number).</li>
                <li>Ventilation method, airway adjuncts, oxygen.</li>
                <li>IV/IO access, medications (adrenaline, amiodarone – dose in mg).</li>
                <li>Compressor rotations, ALS arrival, ROSC indicators.</li>
                <li>Reversible causes considered, time of arrest, downtime.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Initiate chest compressions within 1 minute of recognition of cardiac arrest.</li>
                <li>Deliver the first shock within 1 minute of VT/VF rhythm recognition.</li>
            </ul>
