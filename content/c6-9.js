                <li>Correct dehydration and support perfusion.</li>
                <li>Recognize and escalate care in critical hyperglycemia presentations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients with elevated blood glucose >250 mg/dL.</li>
                <li>Symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, vomiting, weakness, or altered mental status.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>

                <li>Hypoglycemia (RBS <70 mg/dL).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Glucose Measurement:</strong> Check RBS to confirm hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL). Repeat after interventions to monitor response.</li>
                <li><strong>History Specific to Glycemic Disorders:</strong> Confirm history of diabetes (type 1 or type 2), insulin use, or oral hypoglycemic agents. Inquire about recent medication compliance (e.g., missed insulin doses). Identify precipitating factors (comorbidities, infection, stress, dietary changes).</li>
                <li><strong>Symptoms of Hyperglycemia:</strong> Signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, thirst, hypotension, sunken eyes). Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), such as fruity breath, Kussmaul respirations, or severe lethargy. Evaluate mental status (GCS or AVPU).</li>
                <li><strong>Signs of DKA:</strong> Fruity odor on breath, Kussmaul respirations, confusion/altered mental status, dehydration, tachycardia/shock.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine Triage Category:</strong> Red priority for hyperglycemia >324 mg/dL WITH symptoms of DKA/HHS, or signs of shock.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Survey:</strong> For unresponsive patients, perform airway assessment and initiate appropriate airway management. Place unconscious patients in the recovery position at minimum while treatment is being initiated.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Survey:</strong> Complete a focused assessment, including full vital signs, glucose level, and mental status (GCS/AVPU). Perform a 12-lead ECG to evaluate for signs of hyperkalemia (e.g., peaked T-waves, widened QRS) or acute coronary syndrome, especially in elderly or high-risk patients.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back-up:</strong> For severe hyperglycemia with altered mental status, shock, or respiratory distress.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen:</strong> Administer if SpO2 <94% or signs of respiratory distress; titrate to maintain SpO2 =94%.</li>
                <li><strong>Establish IV Access:</strong> For fluid resuscitation and medication administration.</li>
                <li><strong>Fluid Resuscitation:</strong> Administer Normal Saline or Ringer's Lactate for hyperglycemia with signs of dehydration, shock, or DKA:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adults: 500-1000 mL IV bolus (up to 2000 mL), reassess and repeat as needed.</li>
                        <li>Pediatrics: 10-20 mL/kg IV bolus (up to 1000 mL), reassess and repeat as needed (maximum 60 mL/kg).</li>
                        <li>Monitor for signs of fluid overload, especially in patients with cardiac or renal disease.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Patient Reassessment:</strong> Reassess blood glucose every 15 minutes after treatment or fluid administration. Frequently reassess vital signs and mental status.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Monitor for signs of hypoglycemia if patient receives treatment prior to EMS arrival.</li>
                <li>Avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation in patients with renal or cardiac comorbidities.</li>
                <li>Do not delay transport to initiate full fluid replacement therapy.</li>
                <li>Escalate early in patients with altered mental status or suspected DKA/HHS.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Document suspected cause of hyperglycemia (infection, missed insulin, stress).</li>
                <li>Confirm recent medication compliance or omission (insulin or oral agents).</li>
                <li>Assess for abdominal pain or vomiting in DKA patients.</li>
                <li>Avoid oral fluids if patient has altered mental status.</li>
                <li>Inform receiving facility if patient meets criteria for DKA/HHS for early preparation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>

                <li>Fluids administered (type, volume), oxygen therapy, repeat glucose levels.</li>
                <li>Response to treatment, hospital notification.</li>
            </ul>
