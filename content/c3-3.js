            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify patients with tachycardia requiring intervention.</li>
                <li>Identify and treat underlying causes (e.g., shock, sepsis, toxins).</li>
                <li>Restore normal rhythm and hemodynamic stability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <p>Adult patients (≥13 years) presenting with tachycardia (typically HR >150 bpm) and a palpable pulse, conscious or unconscious.</p>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <p>Tachycardia due to a non‑cardiac cause that requires other treatment (e.g., sepsis, pain, hypovolaemia) before rhythm management; paediatric patients (<13 years).</p>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>12‑lead ECG</strong> – identify rhythm: VT, SVT, sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify and treat reversible causes</strong> – toxins, sepsis, pain, hypovolaemia, anaemia, hyperthyroidism.</li>
                <li><strong>Signs of instability</strong> – hypotension, acutely altered mental status, chest pain, shock.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine triage category</strong> – Red priority if VT, SVT, or dysrhythmia with severe shock/hypotension.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary survey</strong> – manage ABC as per Universal Care CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Attach cardiac monitor</strong> – assess rhythm and vital signs; obtain 12‑lead ECG (may be deferred in unstable patient).</li>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back‑up</strong> – as per Universal Care CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify and treat underlying causes</strong> – e.g., pain, fever, hypovolaemia.</li>
                <li><strong>Establish IV access</strong> – consider IO if delayed.</li>
                <li><strong>Assess for signs of instability</strong> – hypotension, altered mental status.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Unstable Patient (with tachycardia and hypotension/shock)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Request ALS back‑up.</li>
                <li><strong>Synchronized cardioversion</strong> – with sedation if time permits (see Joule settings table).</li>
                <li>If rhythm does not revert, increase energy and repeat.</li>
                <li>If patient deteriorates into cardiac arrest, go to Adult Cardiac Arrest CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Adenosine</strong> – may be considered if regular tachycardia and not severely compromised, or if sedation unavailable.</li>
            </ul>
