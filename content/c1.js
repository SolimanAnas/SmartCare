                        <li><strong>Trauma:</strong> C-A-B-C (Catastrophic Hemorrhage, Airway, Breathing, Circulation).</li>
                        <li><strong>Medical:</strong> A-B-C (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Airway:</strong> Ensure patency; C-spine control for trauma.</li>

                        <li><strong>Circulation:</strong> Pulse check (Carotid for unconscious adult, Brachial for infant).</li>
                        <li><strong>Disability:</strong> AVPU & GCS. Check Glucose if AMS (Treat if <strong>< 70 mg/dl</strong>).</li>
                        <li><strong>Red Flags:</strong> Apnea, SpO2 <94%, SBP <90 mmHg, GCS <15.</li>
