            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapidly identify tachycardia in infants and children and determine whether it is compromising perfusion or mental status.</li>
                <li>Distinguish between physiologic sinus tachycardia (often a response to stress, pain, or fever) and dangerous tachyarrhythmias requiring intervention.</li>
                <li>Maintain adequate oxygenation, perfusion, and cerebral function.</li>
                <li>Systematically explore and correct potential underlying causes: excessive stimulants, illicit drug use, pre-existing cardiac conditions, cardiac failure, severe infections.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Infants and children =13 years presenting with a heart rate above normal for age, with or without signs of instability.</li>
                <li>Age-specific concerning heart rates: infant (<1 yr) >220 bpm; child (1�10 yrs) >180 bpm; adolescent (>10 yrs) >180 bpm.</li>
                <li>Signs of poor perfusion: altered mental status, weak pulses, hypotension, prolonged capillary refill (>3 seconds), pallor, cyanosis, respiratory distress.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Age-appropriate sinus tachycardia (e.g., due to fever, pain, dehydration) without instability.</li>
                <li>Known chronic arrhythmias in stable condition.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Survey:</strong> Use the Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT) to assess appearance, work of breathing, circulation. Look for evidence of shock or impending cardiac/respiratory arrest.</li>
                <li><strong>Airway & Breathing:</strong> Check for signs of respiratory distress, hypoxia, or failure; auscultate for wheezing, stridor, or silent chest.</li>
                <li><strong>Circulation:</strong> Assess central and peripheral pulses for rate, regularity, strength; capillary refill, skin color, temperature; blood pressure if feasible.</li>
                <li><strong>Heart Rate & Rhythm Assessment:</strong> Count HR for a full minute. Apply ECG to differentiate:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sinus tachycardia: gradual onset, HR appropriate for age & context, variable R-R interval.</li>
                        <li>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): abrupt onset, very high rate (>220 infant, >180 child), narrow QRS, poor perfusion.</li>
                        <li>Ventricular tachycardia (VT): widened QRS, monomorphic or polymorphic.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reversible Causes:</strong> Fever, dehydration, pain, hypoxia, anxiety, toxins, metabolic disorders.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine Triage Category:</strong> Red priority for HR >220 in infants or >180 in children with signs of poor perfusion (altered mental status, hypotension, weak pulses, cyanosis, respiratory distress). Yellow priority for HR elevated but stable perfusion, normal mental status, responsive to initial vagal maneuvers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back-up:</strong> Routinely for pediatric tachycardia with instability.</li>
                <li><strong>Calm and Systematic Approach:</strong> Keep child warm, minimize stress; allow caregiver presence if calming.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygenation & Ventilation:</strong> Ensure patent airway; administer oxygen titrated to target SpO2 =94% and normocapnia (EtCO2 35-45 mmHg). If respiratory failure or apnea, start BVM ventilation.</li>
                <li><strong>12-Lead ECG:</strong> Perform if possible; continuously monitor rhythm.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Glucose:</strong> Check and treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia as per appropriate CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>IV Access:</strong> Establish if at risk of deterioration or requiring fluid/medication; IO if IV fails.</li>
                <li><strong>Cardiopulmonary Compromise Assessment:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stable:</strong> Tachyarrhythmia with adequate perfusion (no significant hypotension, good mental status, warm extremities, normal capillary refill).</li>
                        <li><strong>Unstable:</strong> Tachyarrhythmia with signs of poor perfusion: altered mental status, hypotension, weak/absent peripheral pulses, cool/mottled skin, respiratory distress.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                                <li>Assess underlying causes (fever, pain, dehydration, anxiety).</li>
                                <li>If sinus tachycardia: treat underlying cause.</li>
                                <li>If SVT suspected: attempt vagal maneuvers (modified Valsalva, ice water to face).</li>
                                <li>If vagal maneuvers ineffective and IV/IO access available: administer Adenosine.
                                    <ul>

                                <li>If rhythm is regular and monomorphic: adenosine may be considered after Tele-EMS consultation (routine administration not recommended).</li>
                                <li>If irregular or polymorphic ? consult expert; avoid adenosine.</li>
                                <li>Prepare for possible deterioration; have cardioversion equipment ready.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Narrow-complex (likely SVT):
                            <ul>
                                <li>Consider vagal maneuvers if clinical condition sufficiently stable.</li>
                                <li>If ineffective or too unstable: consider Adenosine (same doses as above).</li>
                                <li>If adenosine fails or child deteriorates: synchronized cardioversion.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>1st dose: 0.5�1 J/kg; if ineffective: 2 J/kg.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Wide-complex (likely VT):

                                <li>Proceed directly to synchronized cardioversion (same doses).</li>
                                <li>If rhythm is regular and monomorphic and child remains stable enough, consider adenosine (after Tele-EMS consultation).</li>
                                <li>Administer sedation if time and stability permit, but do not delay cardioversion.</li>

                <li><strong>Patient Reassessment:</strong> Frequently reassess vital signs, rhythm, response to interventions. Continuous ECG monitoring required.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid delays in cardioversion if the patient is unstable.</li>
                <li>Ensure correct dosing of adenosine and monitor for transient asystole.</li>
                <li>Be prepared to escalate to CPR if interventions fail.</li>
                <li>Minimize patient agitation to reduce cardiac demand.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pediatric tachycardia is often secondary to hypoxia or shock � address underlying causes promptly.</li>
                <li>If rhythm is unclear, patient deteriorates, or advanced interventions (e.g., cardioversion, advanced airway) may be needed, consult Tele-EMS.</li>
                <li>Differentiate between sinus tachycardia (common with fever, pain, dehydration) and SVT (abrupt onset, often >220 in infants).</li>
                <li>Vagal maneuvers: modified Valsalva (blowing through a syringe) or ice water applied to face (diving reflex) may be effective in infants.</li>
                <li>Sedation for cardioversion: consider midazolam or ketamine if time permits.</li>
            </ul>
