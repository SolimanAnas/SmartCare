                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infection History:</strong> Identify potential sources of infection (respiratory, urinary, skin, abdominal). Recent illness, surgery, invasive procedures, immunocompromised states (diabetes, cancer, HIV).</li>
                <li><strong>Sepsis Screening (SIRS Criteria):</strong> Assess for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) � two or more of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Temperature >38�C or <36�C.</li>

                <li><strong>Source Identification:</strong> Look for localized signs of infection (erythema, purulent discharge, cough with sputum). Check for medical devices (catheters, central lines).</li>
                <li><strong>Determine Triage Category:</strong> Red priority for septic shock, hypotension, or altered mental status.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>

                <li><strong>Primary and Secondary Surveys:</strong> Perform as per Universal Care CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen:</strong> Titrate to maintain SpO2 =94% if hypoxia or respiratory distress.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider ALS back-up:</strong> For septic shock, severe respiratory distress, or altered mental status.</li>
                <li><strong>IV Access:</strong> Establish IV/IO access for fluid resuscitation and medication.</li>
                <li><strong>Fluid Resuscitation:</strong> Administer Normal Saline or Ringer's Lactate for signs of sepsis or septic shock:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adults: 500-1000 mL bolus IV, repeat as needed (up to 2000 mL).</li>
                        <li>Pediatrics: 20 mL/kg bolus IV, repeat as needed (max 60 mL/kg).</li>
                        <li>Monitor for fluid overload, especially in patients with cardiac or renal comorbidities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Paracetamol:</strong> Indicated to reduce fever and improve patient comfort.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adults: 1 g IV/PO.</li>
                        <li>Pediatrics: 15 mg/kg IV/PO (max 1 g).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Vasopressors (Adrenaline):</strong> Indicated for fluid-refractory hypotension.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Push dose: Adults 0.01 mg every 2-5 minutes; Pediatrics 0.005 mg/kg every 2-5 minutes.</li>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Patient Reassessment:</strong> Frequently reassess vital signs, mental status, and response to interventions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients who meet SIRS criteria must be recommended transfer to hospital.</li>
                <li>Use caution with fluid resuscitation in patients with cardiac or renal disease.</li>
                <li>Adrenaline infusions require careful monitoring; reduce doses in patients with underlying cardiac disease.</li>
                <li>In children <5 years, IV push adrenaline is preferred over infusion when a syringe driver is not available.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Elderly patients:</strong> Fever may be absent; present with lethargy, confusion, or falls. Tachycardia may be masked by beta-blockers. Baseline hypertension may mask hypotension.</li>
                <li><strong>Pediatric patients:</strong> Fever may be the only sign; assess for irritability, poor feeding, or lethargy.</li>
                <li>Clearly identify to Dispatch 2 that the patient meets SIRS criteria when coordinating hospital admission.</li>
                <li>Early recognition and treatment of sepsis improves outcomes; do not delay transport.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>

                <li>Suspected source of infection, recent procedures, immunosuppression.</li>
                <li>Fluids administered (type, volume), medications given (paracetamol, adrenaline).</li>
                <li>Response to treatment, hospital notification.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Assess and document SIRS criteria for all suspected sepsis patients.</li>
                <li>Assess and document temperature for all suspected sepsis patients.</li>
