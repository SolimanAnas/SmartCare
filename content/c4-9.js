            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accurately verify death to confirm that no further resuscitation efforts are required.</li>
                <li>Ensure effective communication with Dispatch and other Emergency Services.</li>
                <li>Ensure appropriate documentation is completed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients presenting with clinical signs suggestive of irreversible death, including decomposition, obvious rigor mortis, dependent lividity (hypostasis), incineration, decapitation, or injuries totally incompatible with life.</li>
                <li>Patients requiring confirmation of death after resuscitative efforts have been completed and death has been declared (see Starting, Stopping or Transferring CPR CPG).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Unconscious patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria listed above.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Termination of resuscitation efforts:</strong> Verify unresponsiveness (AVPU: U), absence of spontaneous breathing or only agonal gasps for at least 60 seconds, absence of pulse (carotid or femoral) for at least 60 seconds, 4‑lead ECG showing asystole for at least 60 seconds, absence of heart sounds for at least 60 seconds, absence of neurological function (pupils non‑reactive to light). Note time of death declared.</li>
                <li><strong>Definitive signs of irreversible death:</strong> Check for rigor mortis (stiffening of muscles, typically onset 2‑6 hours post‑death), dependent lividity (pooling of blood in dependent areas, appearing as purplish discoloration), catastrophic injuries incompatible with life (e.g., decapitation, incineration, decomposition, massive crush injuries).</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental and contextual assessment:</strong> Note scene conditions (e.g., body position, evidence of prolonged downtime). Identify any suspicious circumstances (e.g., trauma, ligature marks) requiring police involvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verification of death:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Confirm signs of death: unresponsiveness, no breathing (≥60 sec), no pulse (≥60 sec), 4‑lead ECG asystole (≥60 sec), no heart sounds, non‑reactive pupils.</li>
                        <li>Note the time of death declared.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inform dispatch of death declaration and request black ambulance (deceased person ambulance).</li>
                        <li>Notify dispatch if any suspicious circumstances exist and request police assistance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Post‑verification management:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Suspicious circumstances:</strong> Preserve the scene for police or coroner investigation; avoid disturbing the body or surroundings unless necessary for safety or death verification.</li>
                        <li><strong>Informed by dispatch that a life‑threatening call is waiting:</strong> Ensure dispatch is aware of any special circumstances (e.g., police not yet on scene or body in a public place).</li>
                        <li><strong>If directed by police to remain on‑scene:</strong> Comply and document.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not transport a body in an ambulance vehicle unless:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The body is recently deceased and in a public place where public concern may be caused if left there.</li>
                        <li>The emotional circumstance associated with the death causes severe distress for the family.</li>
                        <li>Prior to transport, an arrangement is in place to accept the body at the destination (coordinate and confirm with dispatch).</li>
                        <li>As instructed by higher management.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification: full name, age, gender.</li>
                <li>Mechanism/medical complaint: context of arrest or condition leading to assessment (e.g., collapse, trauma, found unresponsive).</li>
                <li>Injuries/information: obvious signs of irreversible death (decomposition, rigor mortis, decapitation), suspicious marks, last known alive.</li>
                <li>Signs: confirmed absence of breathing, pulse, heart sounds, neurological response; 4‑lead ECG strip showing asystole (≥60 seconds); if agonal ECG, wait until flat line then take copy.</li>
                <li>Treatment: time of arrest (if known), time CPR stopped (if applicable), time of death declaration, any interventions performed prior to verification (e.g., airway, IV attempts).</li>
                <li>Allergies: not applicable unless relevant history.</li>
                <li>Medications: any found medications that may indicate cause of death or chronic illness.</li>
                <li>Background: medical history, living situation, family witness statements.</li>
                <li>Other: scene description, presence of bystanders, police involvement, emotional distress observed. If transported, reason and confirmation of receiving facility. Communication with dispatch and coordination steps. Accurate timestamp of each assessment point.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure documentation includes confirmation of all vital sign absences, ECG documentation, and time of death declaration.</li>
            </ul>
