            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct a full vital signs assessment and obtain a 12‑lead ECG promptly, considering right‑sided and posterior leads when indicated.</li>
                <li>Determine the exact time of symptom onset – this is critical for reperfusion decisions.</li>
                <li>Expedite transport to an appropriate cardiac hospital while initiating prehospital management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <p>Patients with ischemic‑type symptoms (chest pain/pressure, dyspnoea, diaphoresis, nausea, dizziness, syncope, palpitations) or ECG changes suggestive of ACS (STEMI, NSTEMI, new LBBB, ischemic T‑wave inversions/ST depressions). Also include non‑specific presentations where a cardiac cause cannot be excluded, or hemodynamic compromise with suspected cardiac origin.</p>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>12‑lead ECG:</strong> Obtain as soon as possible. Consider right‑sided leads (V4R) for inferior STEMI and posterior leads (V7‑V9) if high suspicion of posterior infarction.</li>
                <li><strong>Time of onset:</strong> Ask precisely when the discomfort began; this determines eligibility for reperfusion therapy.</li>
                <li><strong>Pain characteristics:</strong> Use OPQRST to differentiate ischemic from non‑ischemic or non‑cardiac chest pain (see table below).</li>
                <li><strong>Triage category:</strong> Red priority if STEMI, haemodynamic instability, or chest pain with signs of shock.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Management</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oxygen:</strong> Only if SpO₂ < 94% (or respiratory distress). Target 94‑98%.</li>
                <li><strong>Aspirin:</strong> 162‑324 mg chewed immediately. If the patient has taken aspirin within the last 60 minutes, give additional aspirin to reach a total of 324 mg.</li>
                <li><strong>GTN (Glyceryl Trinitrate):</strong> 0.4 mg sublingual every 3‑5 minutes for ongoing ischaemic pain, provided SBP ≥ 100 mmHg. Maximum 3 doses. Contraindicated if phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil) taken in last 24 hours, or inferior STEMI with suspected right ventricular involvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Morphine:</strong> For severe pain only (not routinely). Give 1‑2 mg IV increments every 5‑10 minutes (max 10 mg).</li>
                <li><strong>Fluids:</strong> If SBP < 90 mmHg and no signs of pulmonary oedema, give 250 mL normal saline IV/IO bolus; repeat cautiously.</li>
                <li><strong>ALS back‑up:</strong> Request early if haemodynamically unstable, refractory pain, or if sedation/cardioversion may be needed.</li>
                <li><strong>ECG monitoring:</strong> Continuous 4‑lead monitoring; apply defibrillator pads to all STEMI patients.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>ECG Interpretation & Special Situations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>STEMI:</strong> ST elevation at the J point in two contiguous leads (≥1 mm in limb leads, ≥2 mm in precordial leads) or new LBBB. Expedite transport to a PCI‑capable hospital.</li>
                <li><strong>NSTEMI / unstable angina:</strong> ST depression, T‑wave inversions, or no dynamic changes. Perform serial ECGs. Contact Tele‑EMS if Occlusion Myocardial Infarction (OMI) is suspected (subtle signs: hyperacute T‑waves, reciprocal changes, ST depression in multiple leads).</li>
                <li><strong>Right ventricular infarct:</strong> Suspect in inferior STEMI; avoid GTN and give fluids cautiously. Obtain right‑sided ECG (V4R).</li>
                <li><strong>Posterior infarct:</strong> Look for tall R waves and ST depression in V1‑V3; obtain posterior leads V7‑V9.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Differential Features of Chest Pain</h4>

            </table>

            <h4>Transport & Handover</h4>
            <p>Transport the patient to the nearest appropriate cardiac hospital (preferably with PCI capability). Notify the receiving facility early, especially if STEMI or high‑risk features. Provide a concise handover using IMIST‑AMBO, including ECG findings and time of symptom onset.</p>

            <h4>Key Performance Indicators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>12‑lead ECG obtained within 5 minutes of arrival (or as soon as possible).</li>

            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Inferior STEMI can involve the right ventricle; right ventricular infarction makes the patient preload‑dependent, so GTN can cause profound hypotension."

            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Tall R waves and ST depression in V1‑V4 are reciprocal changes of a posterior infarction. Posterior leads (V7‑V9) may show ST elevation."

            correct: 0,
            explanation: "Pericarditic pain is often sharp, pleuritic, and relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. ST elevation in pericarditis is diffuse, not confined to a vascular territory."

            correct: 3,
            explanation: "Cardiogenic shock is defined by hypotension (SBP <90) and evidence of end‑organ hypoperfusion (cool skin, altered mental status, oliguria). Tachycardia and JVD may be present."

            correct: 3,
            explanation: "ST elevation in contiguous leads meets STEMI criteria. Even if pain‑free, he requires immediate transport to a PCI‑capable hospital. Aspirin and GTN can be given en route."
