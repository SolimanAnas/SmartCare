            <h4>Patient Care Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapidly identify and manage traumatic cardiac arrest.</li>
                <li>Perform high‑quality resuscitation (CPR) and specific interventions related to traumatic arrest to maximize survival.</li>
                <li>Ensure safe transport to a trauma center.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Adult and pediatric patients presenting with traumatic cardiac arrest, including unresponsiveness with no signs of life (no pulse, no breathing, or agonal gasps) following significant trauma.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Exclusion Criteria</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Non‑traumatic cardiac arrest patients.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Assessment Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Traumatic cardiac arrest confirmation:</strong> Perform primary survey as per Universal Care CPG. Verify unresponsiveness (AVPU: U), absent pulse (carotid or femoral) for 5‑10 seconds, absent normal breathing or agonal gasps.</li>
                <li><strong>Trauma mechanism assessment:</strong> Identify mechanism of injury (blunt vs. penetrating, location such as chest, abdomen, or head). Assess for high‑risk injuries likely causing arrest (e.g., tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, cardiac tamponade).</li>
                <li><strong>Signs of irreversible death:</strong> In unwitnessed traumatic cardiac arrest, identify decapitation, incineration, body decomposition, rigor mortis – if any present, CPR not required.</li>
                <li><strong>Futile resuscitation assessment:</strong> For unwitnessed traumatic arrest, if ALL of the following are present: blunt or penetrating trauma, no spontaneous movement, no pupillary response, apneic and pulseless, ECG shows no organized rhythm – then CPR is not indicated.</li>
                <li><strong>Triage category:</strong> All cardiac arrest patients are Red Priority.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Management & Interventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deciding to start CPR:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Witnessed cardiac arrest:</strong> If arrest witnessed by ambulance staff, CPR should be initiated.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unwitnessed cardiac arrest:</strong> Check for signs of irreversible death. If any present, do not start CPR. If none, assess futility criteria; if all criteria met, do not start CPR. Otherwise, start CPR.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Request ALS back‑up:</strong> Consider requirement for ALS back‑up as per Universal Care CPG. If resuscitation started, ALS back‑up should be considered. Transfer to hospital prioritized; do not wait on scene – meet ALS en route.</li>
                <li><strong>Perform resuscitation (CPR):</strong> As per Adult or Pediatric Cardiac Arrest CPG.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider specific trauma interventions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pelvic binder:</strong> Consider placement if pelvic fracture suspected (e.g., mechanism, instability). Should be placed before chest compressions start; time permitted for placement limited to 30 seconds after no pulse is felt.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bilateral chest needle decompression:</strong> Consider if cause of arrest unclear (e.g., polytrauma) or tension pneumothorax suspected. Perform in the 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line on both sides.</li>
                        <li><strong>Control active external bleeding:</strong> Identify and immediately control using direct pressure, wound packing, or tourniquets as appropriate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tranexamic acid (TXA):</strong> Consider if arrest witnessed or signs of massive hemorrhage (penetrating trauma, major limb injury, severe pelvic fracture). Dose: Adults 1g IV/IO over 10 minutes; Pediatrics 15mg/kg IV/IO over 10 minutes (max 1g). Contraindicated if unwitnessed with prolonged downtime or non‑survivable injuries.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Transport:</strong> All traumatic cardiac arrest patients must be transported to a trauma center. Minimize scene time. See Starting, Stopping or Transferring CPR CPG for guidance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Resuscitation should be initiated in cases where mechanism of injury does not correlate with clinical condition, suggesting non‑traumatic cause.</li>
                <li>Pelvic binder placement should not delay chest compressions beyond 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Needle decompression may be life‑saving if tension pneumothorax present.</li>
                <li>TXA should be given early (within 3 hours of injury).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>For guidance on stopping or transferring CPR cases in trauma, see the Starting, Stopping or Transferring CPR CPG.</li>
                <li>TXA is not routinely indicated in patients already in cardiac arrest unless high suspicion that arrest is due to massive hemorrhage and ROSC achievable.</li>
                <li>Uncontrolled hemorrhage is a common reversible cause of traumatic cardiac arrest – address rapidly.</li>
            </ul>
