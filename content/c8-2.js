                <li><strong>Primary Survey:</strong> Perform as per Universal Care CPG. Provide BVM ventilation if RR <10 or SpO2 <94%. Suction as needed to clear airway from vomitus.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen Therapy:</strong> Administer high-flow O2 for all patients with hypoxia or respiratory depression; target SpO2 =94%.</li>
                <li><strong>Naloxone Administration:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>IN (Intranasal):</strong> 4 mg (single puff per nostril). Repeat every 2�3 min if needed, max 8 mg.</li>
                        <li><strong>IM or IV:</strong> 0.4 mg; titrate to respiratory effort, may repeat every 2�3 min, max 10 mg.</li>
                        <li>If no response after 10 mg total ? suspect alternative diagnosis.</li>
                        <li>Maintain ventilation support � naloxone has shorter half-life than some opioids.</li>
                        <li>Be prepared for agitation or withdrawal after reversal.</li>

                <li><strong>Transport Considerations:</strong> Transport all opioid overdose patients, even if they initially respond to naloxone. Provide early notification to receiving facility if airway or cardiovascular support is required. Notify dispatch and police if drug overdose suspected before transport.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Patient Safety Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain airway protection at all times.</li>
                <li>Do not rely on response to naloxone alone to rule out other causes.</li>

                <li>Anticipate withdrawal-related agitation and ensure scene safety.</li>
                <li>Avoid judgmental behavior; overdose is a medical emergency.</li>
                <li>Use Broselow tape for pediatric dosing and airway sizing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clinical Insights & Additional Guidance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Poly-substance overdose is common; always consider co-ingestants.</li>
                <li>Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal, especially in opioid-dependent patients.</li>
                <li>Pediatric opioid ingestion can be lethal even in small amounts; escalate early.</li>
                <li>If patient becomes aggressive after naloxone, ensure crew safety and request support.</li>
                <li>Tele-EMS consultation recommended for complex cases or recurrent overdoses.</li>
