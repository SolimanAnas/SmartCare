# 📋 Requirements Specification — SmartCare

**Project:** SmartCare — Clinical Review Platform
**Document type:** Software / Security Requirements Specification (SRS)
**Derived from:** *Secure Development Lifecycle Policy and Procedure* (Secure SDLC), Version 1.1 (07-02-2025), Classification **Shared – Confidential**
**Prepared:** 2026-06-08 · **Status:** Draft for review/approval
**Classification:** Shared – Confidential

> **How this maps to the policy.** The Secure SDLC Procedure requires a layered requirements set: a **Business Requirement Specification (BRS, §6.1)**, a **Supplementary Business Specification (SBS, §6.2)** for Quality of Service, and a **Systems Requirement Specification (SRS, §6)** that *must* contain explicit **Security Requirements**, plus a **Software Architecture Document Security View (§6 SAD)**. This file consolidates those mandated sections for the CPG-2025 application. It is the input the policy expects to hand to "IT Solution Delivery teams involved in development, testing and maintenance."

### 3.2 Assumptions & Dependencies
- TLS/HTTPS terminated at the hosting platform (Render).
- Google OAuth client credentials provisioned and held as environment secrets.
- reference security standards (IT Security, Password, Application & Database Security, Encryption & Key Management, Security Monitoring) are available and binding — see §7.

### 3.3 Functional requirements (summary)
| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| FR-1 | Register a user with name, email, professional level, password. |
| FR-2 | Authenticate via email/password (hashed) or Google OAuth 2.0. |
| FR-3 | Serve guideline content, flashcards, quizzes, drug calculator, ECG tools. |
| FR-4 | Persist per-user progress. |
| FR-5 | Provide an admin console to list/manage users and roles. |
| FR-6 | Operate offline for cached content. |

### 3.4 Interface requirements
- REST-style JSON API (`/api/register`, `/api/login`, `/api/google-login`, `/api/logout`, `/api/admin/users`).
- Static asset serving for the PWA shell and content.

### 3.5 Traceability
Each Security Requirement (§4) is traceable to a Policy clause and to an ISR/ISO control (§8). A full traceability matrix is maintained in `docs/security/COMPLIANCE_TRACEABILITY.md` (to be created).

## 4. Security Requirements — *policy §4.2, §6 SRS "Security Requirements", §6 SAD Security View*

> These are **mandatory**. The policy §4.2(b) names the controls that must be identified — *authentication, access control, encryption, input validation, and error handling* — and §6 SAD enumerates the Security View items. Each requirement below has an ID, the control, an acceptance criterion, and its mapping.

### 4.1 Identification & Authentication *(SAD: Identification, Authentication · §4.2, §4.4(c))*
| ID | Requirement | Acceptance criterion |
|----|-------------|----------------------|
| SR-AUTH-1 | All authentication decisions are made **server-side**; no credential check or auth state in client code. | No secret/hash in front-end; `localStorage` cannot grant access. |
| SR-AUTH-2 | Passwords stored only as salted one-way hashes (Werkzeug PBKDF2/scrypt). | DB never stores plaintext; hash verified server-side. |
| SR-AUTH-3 | Enforce a **password policy** (min length, complexity, common-password block) per Password Security Policy. | Weak passwords rejected at `register`. |
| SR-AUTH-4 | Google OAuth tokens verified server-side against the configured client ID. | Forged/expired tokens rejected (401). |
| SR-AUTH-5 | Rate limiting + lockout on auth endpoints; generic failure messages (no user enumeration). | Brute-force throttled; identical error for bad user vs bad password. |

### 4.2 Authorization & Access Control *(SAD: Authorization · §4.4(c), ISR 8.4.2)*
| ID | Requirement | Acceptance criterion |
|----|-------------|----------------------|
| SR-AUTHZ-1 | Every admin endpoint (`/api/admin/*`) requires authentication **and** an admin-role check. | Anonymous/non-admin → 403; verified by a security test. |
| SR-AUTHZ-2 | The admin dashboard page is gated server-side; unauthenticated requests are redirected/denied. | `/pages/admin.html` not renderable without admin session. |
| SR-AUTHZ-3 | Principle of least privilege for all roles; source-code repo access restricted to authorised developers. | Role matrix enforced; repo branch protection + CODEOWNERS. |

### 4.3 Confidentiality of Data *(SAD: Confidentiality of data · §3.5, §8.4)*
| ID | Requirement | Acceptance criterion |
|----|-------------|----------------------|
| SR-CONF-1 | PII (name, email, professional level) protected in transit (TLS) and at rest (encrypted DB per Encryption & Key Management Policy). | Prod DB encrypted; HTTPS enforced. |
| SR-CONF-2 | No production/PII data in development, test, or version control. | `.gitignore` excludes DBs; test data masked/dummy only. |
| SR-CONF-3 | Admin user list exposes only the minimum necessary fields to authorised admins. | No password hashes or surplus PII returned by APIs. |

### 4.4 Integrity & Input/Output Validation *(§4.4(a), §4.5(b), ISR 8.3.1–8.3.4)*
| ID | Requirement | Acceptance criterion |
|----|-------------|----------------------|
| SR-INT-1 | Validate and sanitise all inputs server-side (type, length, format). | Malformed input rejected with safe errors. |
| SR-INT-2 | Prevent injection (SQLi via ORM/parameterised queries) and XSS (output encoding; avoid unsafe `innerHTML`; CSP). | Security tests for SQLi/XSS pass. |
| SR-INT-3 | Integrity/validation checks on processed and output data. | Tampered parameters/forms rejected. |

### 4.5 Error Handling *(§4.2(b), §4.4(b))*
| ID | Requirement | Acceptance criterion |
|----|-------------|----------------------|
| SR-ERR-1 | Errors handled gracefully; no stack traces or internal detail to clients; **debug mode disabled in production**. | `debug=False` in prod; generic error pages. |

### 4.6 Security Monitoring & Logging *(SAD: Security Monitoring · §3.9, §4.7(b))*
| ID | Requirement | Acceptance criterion |
|----|-------------|----------------------|
| SR-LOG-1 | Log auth events (success/failure) and all admin actions (role change, delete) with timestamp + actor. | Audit trail queryable; shipped to monitored sink. |
| SR-LOG-2 | Security monitoring requirements identified per Security Monitoring Policy. | Monitoring coverage documented. |

### 4.7 Secure Configuration & Transport *(SAD: Network positioning, Hardening · §4.3(c), §4.6(a))*
| ID | Requirement | Acceptance criterion |
|----|-------------|----------------------|
| SR-CFG-1 | All secrets (`SECRET_KEY`, OAuth client/secret, DB URL) injected via environment; app fails fast if unset; **no hard-coded fallbacks**. | No secrets in source or history. |
| SR-CFG-2 | Security headers enforced: CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, frame-ancestors, Referrer-Policy. | Headers present on all responses. |
| SR-CFG-3 | Secure session cookies (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`). | Verified in responses. |
| SR-CFG-4 | OS / web server / DB hardened per the Secure Baseline Document. | Hardening checklist signed off. |
| SR-CFG-5 | Network positioning of components per IT Security Policy; environments separated (dev/SIT vs UAT/prod). | Deployment topology documented in SAD. |

### 4.8 Patch & Database Security *(SAD: Patch Management, Database Security · §4.7(a))*
| ID | Requirement | Acceptance criterion |
|----|-------------|----------------------|
| SR-PATCH-1 | Process to manage security updates/patches; automated dependency scanning (`pip-audit`, Dependabot). | CI fails on High/Critical vulns. |
| SR-DB-1 | Database security per the Database Security Standard (access control, least privilege, encryption). | DB access restricted & audited. |
